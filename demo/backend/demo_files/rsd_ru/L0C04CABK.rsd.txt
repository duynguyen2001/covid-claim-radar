Coronavirus may have appeared in France as early as November 2019 - doctors
Paris, 18 May 2020, 10: 51 - REGNUM In the French hospital in Colmar (Upper Rhine) all X-ray images taken since 1 October 2019 have been reviewed to find out when and how the coronavirus entered the country, reports Le Parisien.
At the Albert Schweitzer Hospital in Colmar, the chief X-ray physician reviewed 2,456 images taken between 15 October and 30 April, and concluded that the first coronavirus patients could have appeared in France as early as November 2019.
On 16 November 2019, Dr. Michel Schmitt discovered "typical lung abnormalities caused by COVID-19."
The first results of the doctor to be confirmed are very interesting for the region badly affected by COVID-19.
According to him, other suspicious cases were identified in December and January, well before the epidemic reached a marked peak.
As reported by IA REGNUM, Sanofi General Manager Paul Hudson had previously apologized to his staff for the "delicate situation" associated with his application for the first batch of COVID-19 vaccine to the United States.

The Fifth Republic in France is going through its worst years.
The ratings of Presidents Sarkozy, Hollande, and Macron begin to beat the record of mistrust very soon after they take office.
Over the past 20 years, the country's influence in the EU has finally taken second place.
However, policy towards Russia, regardless of the head of state, remains relatively neutral within a framework not defined in Paris.
The most significant incident in bilateral relations is the refusal to sell two Mistral-type helicopters.
As a result of that history, it can be said that the damage to France itself from refusing the deal - financial, reputational - far outweighed the possible damage to Russia.
