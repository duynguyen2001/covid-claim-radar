The origin of COVID-19 coronavirus is not the Chinese city of Wuhan, but the U.S. Armed Forces bio-laboratory at Fort Detrick, according to Larry Romanoff of the Canadian Global Research Center.
The virus did not originate in the seafood market, it did not originate in Wuhan and China itself at all, but was imported from another country.
The only possible source of the coronavirus is the United States, because only in this country are all branches of the coronavirus evolutionary tree.
The original source of the COVID-19 virus was the U.S. military laboratory at Fort Detrick, "writes Romanoff, citing research by Japanese and Taiwanese epidemiologists.

In August 2019, a wave of lung pneumonia began in the United States, reportedly caused by the vaporization of electronic cigarettes.
At that time, a Taiwanese doctor, according to Romanoff, wrote to American officials that these diseases, which included fatal outcomes, could be caused by coronavirus, but his warnings were ignored.
Global Research also points out that just before the outbreak, the US shut down the main US military biolab at Fort Detrick for inexplicable reasons.
