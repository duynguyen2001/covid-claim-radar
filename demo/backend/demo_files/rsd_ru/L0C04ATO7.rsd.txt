Restrictions tightened again in Turkey due to COVID-19
The Turkish authorities announced a tightening of restrictions due to the increase in coronavirus cases.
There will be a curfew on weekends again, and cafes and restaurants have been allowed to work only for the removal.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan announced that the country is imposing a weekend curfew due to an increase in the number of COVID-19 infections, RBC reported with reference to IA Anadolu.
The restriction will apply during the month of Ramadan, from 12 April to 12 May.
Coffee and restaurants will work only with skill.
The authorities have provided targeted support for their workers and will pay them 1,500 lire per person for the duration of the restrictions.
The President stressed that 58 cities, representing 80 per cent of Turkey 's population, had already been included in the red category, meaning the highest risk of coronavirus infection.
"If we cannot reduce the number of patients and deaths faster than countries with which we have humanitarian and commercial relations, we will lag behind global normalization," Erdoğan said.
The country has already imposed a curfew on the weekend in November.
At the same time, cinemas were closed, and students switched to online learning.
In early March, Turkey lifted some restrictions.
In particular, in all regions except the Red Zone, restaurants and cafes were opened (with restrictions on occupancy and working time), and restrictions on studies, weddings, assemblies and congresses were lifted.
Turkey plans to open a tourist season in April.
We plan to start with tourist regions.
The opening will start from the Mediterranean Sea and will gradually shift to the Aegean region, "explained the Minister of Culture and Tourism, Mahmet Nuri Ersoy.
According to him, first domestic tourism will resume, then tourists from Britain and Russia will be allowed to come.
All arriving in Turkey must carry a negative coronavirus test until 15 April.
