Murashko referred to the duration of immunity in the case of COVID-19 patients
Those infected with coronavirus infection may remain immune to infection for six months.
The Russian Minister of Health Mikhail Murashko stated this.
Today, in those patients who have had a confirmed coronavirus infection, we see that for the duration, usually up to six months, almost everyone retains immunity, in the majority, - TASS quotes the minister.
He added that even if antibodies were retained, there were no restrictions on vaccination for such patients.
But it is not appropriate to educate such people, as it is first and foremost necessary to reach citizens without immunity.
As reported by NEWS.ru, Murashko had previously stated that some people may have enough of a satellite V vaccine to become immune; a second vaccine may not be required.
Older people are better vaccinated twice.
