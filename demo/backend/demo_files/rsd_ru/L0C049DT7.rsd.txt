Doctors have found out how coffee and tea can help with coronavirus
Their use is important for people at risk.
With the advent of coronavirus infection, many people began looking for "miracle" fruits and vegetables that would help protect the immune system from infection and strengthen it.
It turns out that green tea and coffee can reduce coronavirus mortality by 63 percent.
This is particularly true of people at risk, particularly patients with diabetes and other chronic diseases.
Green tea reduces the risk of developing diabetes in general, and also helps improve glucose control and insulin sensitivity, writes lenta.ua.
Herbs are also rich in a complex of vitamins that have a beneficial effect on human health.
In addition, even coffee can have a beneficial effect on the body.
For example, for diabetics, this drink will be useful, as it also helps to control blood sugar levels.
However, caffeine-containing drinks should be treated with caution for people with cardiovascular and stomach problems.
