Coronavirus source established
Chinese epidemiologists found that the source of coronavirus 2019-nCoV was wild animals whose meat was sold on the market in Wuhan city, as reported by China Central Television, citing the National Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
According to the channel, scientists have made interim progress in investigating the source of the virus.
A new type of coronavirus nucleic acid was found in 33 of the 585 samples taken from the environment of the Huan seafood market in Wuhan.
Scientists have also successfully isolated the virus in positive tests.
The Centre noted that 93 per cent of positive samples were taken in the western part of the wildlife market.
"In summary, there is a high probability that the current epidemic is related to the wildlife trade," said the channel.
According to recent data, the number of deaths from pneumonia caused by coronavirus in China has risen to 57.
Due to the disease, about ten cities in the country are closed to quarantine.
