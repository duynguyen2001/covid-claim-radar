Dental paste can neutralize coronavirus in two minutes.
A toothpaste containing zinc and tin can destroy coronavirus in two minutes.
This was discovered by American scientists, whose findings were published in the British Dental Journal.
Specialists wanted to understand whether oral care facilities could influence the spread of COVID-19.
In addition, the virus can neutralize a mouthwash with cetylpyridine chloride within 30 seconds.
"The results show that some toothpaste and mouthwash fluids can help reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by temporarily reducing the amount of virus in the mouth," says the publication.
Scientists conducted clinical trials on 260 patients who used oral care.
Previously, scientists from the Czech Academy of Sciences had invented bactericidal paper that completely destroys coronavirus 30 minutes after it hits the surface.
