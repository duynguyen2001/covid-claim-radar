In Iran, coronavirus infections have dramatically increased
The daily number of new COVID-19 infections in Iran reached a four-month peak on Monday, as the capital Tehran was at the highest level of risk.
The Islamic Republic is fighting the most deadly outbreak of coronavirus in the Middle East, and the number of cases has increased following a dramatic increase in travel during the Iranian New Year celebrations that began on 18 March.
In the past 24 hours, 13,890 new cases of coronavirus have been reported, according to Ministry of Health spokesperson Sima Sadat Larry in a television presentation.
This is the highest number of daily infections since 4 December and is close to the peak of 14,051 positive cases recorded on 28 November.
According to Larry, the total number of infections exceeded 1.94 million due to newly registered cases.
Health Minister Said Namaki said Iran faced "one of the most serious waves" of the coronavirus.
"Unfortunately, no one listened to me about the management of travel, and today we have had great difficulties," he said, according to the Ministry's website.
- "Now we have lost the reins of government (the virus), and it is not clear when we will be able to reduce the number of deaths to three digits."
Some officials, including Namaki, have acknowledged in the past that the number of coronavirus cases is probably higher than official data.
