Coronavirus appeared in the US before China.
Scientists investigated blood samples from U.S. residents who collected as early as December 2019, and found that some of them had coronavirus even before China announced it.
As part of the study, experts analyzed over 7,000 donor blood samples collected by the American Red Cross in nine states from 13 December 2019 to 17 January 2020.
Of these, 106 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: 39 in California, and 67 in Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin.
Even taking into account the probability of false positive tests, it can still be argued that the virus was already in the US by early December, scientists note.
The presence of antibodies suggests that the donor had previously been in contact with the virus.
Researchers now plan to contact people who have been found to have antibodies to determine if they traveled in late 2019 and experienced symptoms similar to COVID-19.
It has been suggested that the presence of antibodies in a person from the United States may indicate that he recently returned from China.
It has been reported that the virus has been circulating in China since November 2019.........
