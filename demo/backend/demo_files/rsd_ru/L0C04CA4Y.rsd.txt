According to the epidemiologist, the need for re-vaccination will depend on the behaviour of the South African strain
The leading American infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, has admitted that Americans will still have to wear masks by 2022, but measures to combat COVID-19 will be weakened as more people are vaccinated.
Fauci stated this in an interview with CNN.
"I think we will reach a significant level of 'normality' after the terrible burden we had to bear last year," said Fauci.
Speaking on NBC's Meet the Press, Fawcett said it was too early to say when collective immunity would emerge in the United States.
When asked by Fox News whether Americans would need a secondary vaccine, he said that it would depend on how the South African strain of coronavirus develops.
