Moscow, 10 Jan - RIA News.
In Russia, the "British" strain of coronavirus was discovered for the first time, reported the head of the Russian Consumer Surveillance Anna Popova on the channel "Russia 1."
She explained that the virus mutation had been detected in one person during surveys of Russians returning from the United Kingdom.
In mid-December, a new mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was discovered in Britain.
As the local advisory board on new and emerging respiratory viral threats later confirmed, the new strain is spreading faster and requires greater caution from the population.
Although the new version of the virus is estimated to be 70% more contagious than usual, there is no indication yet that it has a higher mortality rate or a more severe course of illness.
