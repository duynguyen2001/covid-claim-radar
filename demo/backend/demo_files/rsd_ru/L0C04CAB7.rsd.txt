In Italy, coronavirus appeared as early as September 2019.
Coronavirus has been circulating in Italy since September 2019 and may have spread outside China earlier than previously thought.
This is evidenced by studies by the National Cancer Institute (INT) of Milan, "European Truth" reports Reuters.
The first patient in Italy with COVID-19 was discovered on 21 February this year in a small town near Milan in the northern region of Lombardy.
The World Health Organization stated that the new coronavirus and its associated respiratory disease, COVID-19, were unknown until the first outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019.
But results from Italian researchers published by the scientific journal INT Tumori Journal show that 11.6% of the 959 healthy volunteers who participated in a lung cancer test between September 2019 and March 2020 developed antibodies to coronavirus long before February.
Another specific antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 was conducted by the University of Siena for the same study.
He showed that four cases, dated to the first week of October, were also positive for antibodies neutralizing the virus, which means they contracted in September.
"This is the main conclusion: people without symptoms were not only positive after serological tests, but also had antibodies capable of killing the virus," said Giovanni Apollone, co-author of the study.
"This means that a new coronavirus can circulate for a long time among a population with a low mortality rate, not because it disappears, but only to resurface," he added.
Italian researchers reported in March that they had warned of a higher than usual number of cases of severe pneumonia and influenza in Lombardy in the last quarter of 2019, a sign that a new coronavirus could spread earlier than was thought.
