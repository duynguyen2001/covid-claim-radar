Peru records coronavirus deaths
Peru reported a record 294 deaths from coronavirus, according to the Ministry of Health, just a week before millions of people had to go out and vote for a new president and a new Congress.
Unlike neighbouring Chile, which was also scheduled to hold elections next Sunday but postponed them because of the health crisis, the President of Peru has decided to move forward.
According to the Ministry, the latest 24-hour death toll surpassed the previous South American record of 277 deaths per day last August, bringing the total death toll to 52,625, with more than 1.5 million infections recorded.
On Saturday, more than 5,600 new cases were reported daily, as the continent is struggling with a surge of infections caused by new versions of the virus, which are believed to be more contagious.
Peru reported a record number of nearly 13,000 new cases on Thursday, with about 200 people dying daily from coronavirus in the last two months in a country of 33 million people.
Vaccination of medical personnel, soldiers, police, firefighters and the elderly began in February.
