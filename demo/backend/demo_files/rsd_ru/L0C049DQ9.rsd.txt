Coronavirus medicine is already on sale in Krasnoyarsk
I went to the pharmacy once.
On the fifth day of self-isolation, I looked critically at the pile of debris.
She didn't have to wait for the art installation yet, but it was already starting to fall apart.
Maybe she didn't.
It's hard to say exactly, because the drops from my stuck nose ran out two days earlier.
So I put on a mask and gloves and went outside.
It was raining.
It was deserted, ugly and dull.
I threw away the trash, and I threw it at the nearest pharmacy.
At the very entrance, I was a little ahead of a 40-year-old woman.
No masks or gloves.
I went inside and faced the line.
The woman was already standing in front of the cash register and asked the pharmacist if the order she had made online was ready.
The pharmacist knocked on the keys, waved her eyebrows, and asked the woman to name a couple of entries from the order so that she could find it.
Well, for example, a woman was slow.
- I had... "NEW PASSIIT"!!
I panicked.
The pharmacist too.
The woman looked at me.
She had a quick glance from head to foot.
She turned to the pharmacist again and added in a much quieter voice:
-... and three packs of condoms.
The pharmacist nodded, smiled, leaned under the counter and delivered the package to the buyer.
- Here.
This is everything you ordered.
Except for Nova Scotia.
He wasn't in the warehouse.
The woman looked at the package.
- It's okay.
Here she looked at me again.
She smiled.
And, before I can count on it, I added:...
-... the point is condoms are...
I don't even know how to be happy for her man or feel for him.
And I still think: who of them really needed "Novopassit..."
