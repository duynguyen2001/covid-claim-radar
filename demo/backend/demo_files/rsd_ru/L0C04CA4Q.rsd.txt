Moscow, 4 June.
/ TASS /.
The need to wear masks in Moscow will continue until mass vaccination against coronavirus begins.
This could happen in October of this year or later, the mayor of the capital, Sergey Sobyanin, reported in an interview with TASS...........
How much we wear masks will depend on the timing of the mass vaccine.
Estimates vary from October to February of the following year.
We want to believe that in October we will get the first large batches of vaccine, "he said.
A man quickly forgets the bad.
That 's his psychology, and thank God.
I think in a year we will be completely back to our old way of life, "the mayor added.
In Moscow, a self-isolation regime began on March 29 due to the situation of the coronavirus, as a result of which many shops, cafes, gymnasiums and other facilities were closed, and the parks were not accessible.
Recently, however, the authorities have gradually relaxed restrictions as the epidemic situation has begun to improve.
Many facilities in the service sector, trade and construction began to work again, but Moscow residents were forced to wear masks and gloves in public places in order to combat the spread of infection.
