WHO experts found out where COVID-19 originated
The WHO International Team of Specialists has concluded that the probable version of the human coronavirus is a bat.
Coronavirus first appeared in Southeast Asia or South China in bats.
They infected a wildlife farm and could have infected the farm's staff, or its residents: gorillas, badgers, and antelope, writes gazeta.ru with a reference to The New York Times, which published an interview with WHO expert Peter Daszak.
Chinese experts also believe that the version of the transmission of coronavirus to humans from wild animals through the intermediate link is the most plausible.
