Coronavirus appeared in Italy as early as the summer of 2019, not in February-2020 - scientists
As of September 2019, 14% of volunteers in Italy who participated in lung cancer research had antibodies to the new coronavirus that existed in the country, probably as early as the summer.
According to Corriere della Sera, the study was carried out by the National Cancer Institute of the IRCCS Foundation in Milan.
We knew that it didn 't start in China in December, but now studies published in November under the signature of Giovanni Apollo, director of the National Cancer Institute in Milan, tell us something quite unexpected: in September 2019, 14 percent of a sample of volunteers who participated in lung cancer research had antibodies to the new coronavirus.
In other words, SARS-Cov-2 circulated in Italy well before February and probably since the summer of 2019, "scientists noted.
The infection was detected in 13 regions of the country.
In particular, in Lombardy, Piedmont, Lazio, Tuscany and Veneto.
It began in the context of screening for lung cancer Smile, which took place from September 2019 to March 2020.
959 volunteers participated.
Participants were given a spiral computer tomography of the lungs and blood tests.
111 samples of 959 were positive for immunoglobulin G (16 cases) or immunoglobulin M (97 cases).
In addition, as early as November 2019, many general practitioners reported severe respiratory symptoms in elderly patients with atypical bilateral bronchitis, which, in the absence of news of the new virus, was associated with aggressive forms of seasonal influenza.
"Now we can say with even greater certainty: it was not the flu, but the first signs of Covid-19, a new disease that no one noticed until the late alarm that China launched at the end of December," the researchers reported.
We recall that according to data today in Italy for 24 hours identified 37 thousand.
255 cases, compared with 40,000 the previous day.
