Study: Old colds protect half of humanity from a new coronavirus
An American study published in the journal Nature supports the hypothesis that a large part of humanity is immune to the new coronavirus due to previous colds.
However, COVID-19 is not protected by specific immunoglobulins that appear in patients' blood and disappear months later, but by T-lymphocytes that store memory of the transmitted infections.
T lymphocytes are part of the "first bastion" of immune protection, innate cellular immunity.
This type of white blood cell stores memories of past infections and is able to recognize and attack familiar enemies, be they allergens, bacteria or viruses.
Earlier studies in different countries have shown that T-lymphocytes that recognize the RNA of the new coronavirus are often present in the blood of people who have never been infected with COVID-19...............
These cells were also found in blood samples taken long before the outbreak of the pandemic.
Various studies have reported that between 20% and 60% of non-infected COVID-19 people have T-lymphocytes "remembering" this new human infection (the latest such study was published in late July - T-lymphocytes responding to the SARS-CoV-2 invasion were found in 35% of healthy blood donors in Germany).
A new study by American scientists confirmed that these T-lymphocytes, predominantly CD4 +, attack those viral RNA elements that are common to SARS-CoV-2 and well-known "old" coronaviruses that cause mild seasonal colds.
Scientists suggest that the cause of the prevalence of asymptomatic forms of coronavirus infection may be cell immunity formed by familiarity with benign forms of coronavirus.
Interest in serological tests for immunoglobulin has recently waned - antibodies are linked to the fight against new coronavirus at a later stage, and the severity of the disease is determined in the early days and depends on innate cellular immunity.
