INTERFAX.RU - Domestic animals cannot be infected with COVID-19 coronavirus and spread it, said Vladimir Burmatov, head of the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, calling on Russians to take animals from shelters.
According to current World Health Organization data, there is no evidence of infection of cats and dogs with COVID-19, nor evidence that domestic animals can spread the virus.
The French health agency Anses has also ruled out the possibility of human transmission of the virus from domestic animals.
These data are also confirmed by domestic scientists.
According to the Central Research Institute of Epidemiology, domestic animals, including cats and dogs, cannot be a source of new coronavirus infection, "Burmatov wrote on Wednesday on Instagram.

The deputy reported that people had started bringing their animals to veterinary clinics and leaving them in shelters for fear of becoming infected, and urged that they should not do so.
"So cats and dogs now from shelters are the opposite time to be dealt with: with them there is no fear of isolation, they will not let you miss quarantine and it is perfectly safe to walk in their company on the street," wrote Burmatov.
On Tuesday more than half of the regions of the Russian Federation adopted restrictive measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection.
They repeat the steps that Moscow and Moscow Region have taken: leaving the apartment and the home is prohibited in all cases except for work trips, urgent medical care, direct health threats, shopping in the nearest shop or pharmacy, garbage removal and pets at a distance of 100 metres from home.
This led to social media jokes about a tired dog who had to walk 60 times a day because he was the only dog in the apartment building.
