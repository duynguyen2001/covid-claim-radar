The virologist told us if the mouthwash could protect against the coronavirus.
Vitaly Zverev, Scientific Director of the Research Institute of Vaccines and Serum named after Mechnikov, reported that oral rinse will not prevent the body from becoming infected with coronavirus, as the virus particles enter both the nose and the respiratory tract.
According to studies by American scientists, a mouthwash containing cetylpyridine chloride (an antiseptic that kills bacteria and microorganisms) can neutralize coronavirus in 30 seconds.
"The results show that some toothpaste and mouthwash fluids can help reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by temporarily reducing the amount of virus in the mouth," says the publication.
Virologist Vitaly Zverev, in turn, said that such devices can kill virus particles only directly in the mouth, and no further protection will pass.
In addition, the virologist stressed that even if the coronavirus particles were to pass through the mouth, they would immediately spread further.
The virus is in the nasal cavity.
You're not gonna rub your nose with dental fluid?
The virus does not live in the mouth, it immediately enters the respiratory tract, "Zverev stressed.
The expert explained that even if the mouth was cleaned, it would not completely rid a person of the virus.
In addition, the virologist warned against the abuse of mouthwashers.
We have our own microflora that protects the organism.
"We're going to kill everyone," he said.
Previously, scientists from the Czech Academy of Sciences had invented bactericidal paper, which destroys coronavirus 30 minutes after it hits the surface.
