Soros, Rockefeller, and Gates were accused of involvement in the COVID-19 pandemic.
The court in Peru accused billionaires George Soros, Stephen Rockefeller, and Bill Gates of involvement in the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
This is reported by Radio RPP.
An appeal for the extension of the detention of a man accused of rape was heard in court.
On the grounds of the refusal to appeal the decision of the previous instance, the judges of the Court of Appeal stated that the criminal proceedings against the defendant had been paralysed by an insurmountable circumstance, namely the COVID-19 pandemic..
The verdict stated that the coronavirus pandemic was "created by criminal elites who rule the world."
"No government of the world, no natural or legal person, nor the defence of the defendant can claim that this pandemic is foreseeable, except its creators among the [authors] of the new world order, such as Bill Gates, Soros, Rockefeller, etc., who have managed it and continue to manage it in the utmost secrecy," the court ruled.
The defendant 's counsel has already stated that it would require the annulment of the Court of Appeal' s decision, stressing that it relies on speculative statements instead of arguments relevant to the case.
