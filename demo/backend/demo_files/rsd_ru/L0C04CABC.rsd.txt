Wastewater showed that coronavirus in Italy appeared in December 2019 - two months earlier than expected.
The Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) discovered coronavirus in sewage samples from two major cities in the north of the country - Milan and Turin - which were taken for analysis as early as December 2019.
Thus, the virus was present in the country at least two months before the first officially confirmed case.
AFP reports.
ISS specialists conducted analysis of 40 wastewater dams collected in Milan, Turin and Bologna from October 2019 to February 2020.
Two different laboratories independently identified SARS-CoV-2 in samples taken from Milan and Turin on 18 December 2019 and in samples taken from Bologna on 29 January 2020.
However, no coronavirus has been detected in samples since October and November 2019.
This, according to Italian doctors, means that he was not in Italy at the time.
According to the ISS, the results "help to understand the beginning of the spread of the virus in Italy" and "confirm the cumulative multiple evidence from around the world" on the role of wastewater analysis in early detection of infectious diseases.
Evidence that coronavirus was actually circulating around the world before it was officially reported has appeared before.
For example, in early May, physician Yves Cohen reported that coronavirus had been detected in France as early as late December 2019.
It was previously believed that the first case of SARS-CoV-2 in the country was recorded on 24 January.
Researchers at Harvard Medical School have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could have spread to China as early as August 2019 - more than four months before the first officially identified case.
Beijing rejects these suggestions.
China officially notified WHO of the new virus on 31 December.
As of June 19, 2014, COVID-19 has confirmed 8,578,283 people worldwide, of whom 4,530,276 have recovered and 456,286 have died from complications.
More than 3.5 million people are still being treated.
