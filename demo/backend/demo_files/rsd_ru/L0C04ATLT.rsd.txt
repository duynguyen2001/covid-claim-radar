Scientists assessed the effectiveness of another method of protecting human beings from COVID-19
Most patients with COVID-19 without symptoms have developed T-cells that signal a collision with infection.
Scientists told RBCs how to use it to control coronavirus
A negative analysis of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 does not mean that the person did not have a coronavirus infection, such people may have been resistant to the virus by T-lymphocytes, told RBC Head of Laboratory of Transplantation Immunology of the National Medical Research Centre (NMIC) of Hematology of the Ministry of Health Grigory Efimov.
According to him, the easier it is for a person to get coronavirus, the more likely it is that he will not have antibodies.
This has already been demonstrated by data from several scientific works, including a study organized on the basis of NMIC haematology together with scientists from other Russian universities, says Efimov.
The study, the results of which have already been published in the authoritative American journal Immunity, was attended by staff and students of the MSU and the NMIC Hematology.
In total, according to Efimov, there are 34 sick volunteers and two groups of healthy donors of 14 and 10.
We 've been studying how they have antibodies and T-cell [immune] responses.
The vast majority of patients who do not have antibodies have a T-cell.................
In another study we specifically recruited people without antibodies who were in close contact with the patients, they did not develop the disease themselves and found: more percent of them have T lymphocytes, "Efimov told RBC, explaining that the last category most likely carried COVID-19 without symptoms.
