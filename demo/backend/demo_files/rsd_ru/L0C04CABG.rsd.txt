Study: Coronavirus appeared in Italy as early as September last year
A new type of coronavirus appeared in Italy as early as September 2019, much earlier than it was first detected, according to a study by the National Cancer Institute.
A coronavirus in a patient in Italy was first detected in February 2020, in a small town near Milan.
However, data from Italian researchers published in the Tumori Journal show that 11.6% of the 959 healthy volunteers who participated in lung cancer screening between September 2019 and March 2020 developed antibodies to coronavirus well before February.
Another specific antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 was conducted by the University of Siena for the same study called "Unexpected Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in the Pre-Pandemic Period in Italy."
It showed that in four cases dated the first week of October, the antibodies neutralizing the virus were also positive, i.e. the patients became infected in September, Reuters reported co-author of the study Giovanni Apollo.
