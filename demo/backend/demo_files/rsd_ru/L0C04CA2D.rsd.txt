Scientists: COVID-19 could adapt to the human body as early as 2012
The new coronavirus could adapt to the human body as early as 2012, writes RIA Novosti with reference to The Sun.
The researchers found records of a doctor who treated miners from Yunnan Province of China who spent two weeks cleaning the mine with bat feces.
Symptoms associated with COVID-19 were pneumonia, dry cough, leg pain and high temperature.
The patients needed lung ventilation, and three of the six workers died.
Samples of the miners' tests were sent to a laboratory in Wuhan, where they were found to have contracted coronavirus-like pneumonia.
Thus, as the researchers emphasize, there is reason to believe that COVID-19 has already been adapted to the human body.
In recent months, various versions of the emergence of a new coronavirus have been proposed.
However, the World Health Organization notes that the infection is not yet well studied to draw clear conclusions.
Experts continue their studies.
