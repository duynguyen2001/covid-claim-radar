In response to our question at Clubhouse (the professor allowed her to quote), Ancha Baranova said: If even a person with a high level of antibodies after vaccination is not afraid to walk without a mask, and if his mucous (nose or mouth) coronavirus is no longer dangerous to him, it does not eliminate the danger for others.
When breathing or talking, the human-protected SARS-CoV-2 vaccine can be passed on to others.
Therefore, the refusal of those educated to wear masks is "irresponsible," said Professor Baranova.
However, the biologist has not denied that "contact" with small amounts of coronavirus can train immunity of the infected.
Earlier, scientists made a simple argument by explaining the need to wear masks in a pandemic, although they did not guarantee full protection.
Masks, in any case, reduce the number of viral particles that attack a person - one if the body immediately encounters a huge "dose" of SARS-CoV-2, and another if it is much smaller.
