Peak still ahead: Chinese coronavirus mutated and spread faster
Come on, you bastards, you don't have to eat it all in a row, if you don't really feel.......
Yeah... see what they're eating there and what they're selling in the markets...
We already have three in the Czech Republic suspected of this coronavirus.
People start buying masks...
Well, suspicion... it 's not infected - until I' ve seen you put in the statistics - here 's one flight in the United States, and it' s already there.
All three are in solitary confinement.
The results will be tomorrow.
Thanks for the information.
One has already been released - the suspicion has not been confirmed.
I think (hopefully) that most likely the rest will be okay.
