Phylogenetic studies show that coronavirus appeared as early as October in Wuhan
A group of scientists from the Institute of Biodiversity Studies (IRBio) of the University of Barcelona, in their phylogenetic study, concluded that coronavirus appeared at least in October 2019 in the territory of Uhan.
This is what Frontiersin writes.
In a new study, scientists report that at the time of the introduction of coronavirus in October 2019, the virus spread almost asymptomatic without causing epidemics.
Three conditions are required for the spread of infectious disease, scientists say - the pathogen must be capable of infecting and reproducing in humans, there must be contact between humans and the reservoir of the pathogen, and finally it must spread in a densely populated area.
All the factors necessary for the development of COVID-19 were in this area of China at the end of 2019.
Researchers note that the development of coronavirus infection was due to a random coincidence of biological and social factors - the virus appeared in this area at the end of the year, before the Chinese New Year, when infected people began to move massively to other regions.
However, scientists note that COVID-19 has many factors similar to previous coronaviruses.
Coincidentally, there will be other major pandemics of coronavirus infections in the future, because there are thousands of such viruses.
The first case of coronavirus infection in France was discovered in December 2019.
On 27 December, in the outskirts of Paris, a patient with pneumonia was tested several months later on COVID-19 and found to.
