Mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 D614G coronavirus has made it 8 times more contagious
According to research conducted by scientists from New York University, the Genome Center, and Mount Sinai Hospital, coronavirus mutations make it even more dangerous.
Experts have come to the unfortunate conclusion that as coronavirus evolves, it becomes even more dangerous.
A coronavirus mutation, D614G, was discovered in early 2020.
Today it is one of the most common mutations on Earth, including the United States.
According to Nevill Sanjan, New York University's Associate Professor of Biology and Associate Professor of Neuroscience and Physiology at the Grossman Medical School, in the months since scientists began the study, the importance of the D614G coronavirus mutation has increased even more.
"The fact that the mutation is more contagious partly explains why the virus has spread so rapidly over the course of the year," the expert believes..
As part of the tests, researchers introduced common and mutated viruses into cells of the human lung liver and large intestine.
It was found that the D614G mutation increased the virus's ability to spread, becoming eight times more infectious than the COVID-19 virus.
The mutation made the infection much more resistant to other proteins.
But contagion is so far the only difference that scientists have discovered.
There is no evidence that mutating the virus results in a more severe disease.
But scientists are determined to determine whether there is such a relationship.
New studies will be undertaken to this end.
It was previously reported that a German scientist had reported an increase in the number of coronavirus mutations as the population was vaccinated against COVID-19.
