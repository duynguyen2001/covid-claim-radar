MOSCOW, 2 Dec..
The journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, with reference to medical scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, published a sensational discovery.
Experts have discovered that blood samples taken from residents of various U.S. states by Red Cross personnel for donor purposes were found to contain positive antibodies to COVID as early as December 2019.
That is, before a new dangerous coronavirus epidemic was announced in China.
Note that the starting point of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic is 31 December 2019.
At that time, the government officially announced the emergence of a new mysterious disease.
In the United States, the first case of coronavirus was confirmed 20 days later in January 2020.
The virus was diagnosed in a Washington resident who came to the country from China.
