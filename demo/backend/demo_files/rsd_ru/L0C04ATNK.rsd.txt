Scientists have discovered two new mutations in the coronavirus...

Earlier, several media outlets reported, with reference to a White House working group on COVID-19, that a new, more contagious strain of coronavirus could appear in the United States, spreading 1.5 times more than the original version.
However, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) denied this information.
According to the Ohio University statement, the first mutation, although similar to "British," probably originated in the United States.
Another strain acquired three genetic mutations that had not previously met together in SARS-Cov-2.
The first strain was recently discovered in a patient in Ohio, and scientists are not yet able to say how widespread it has become.
The second option became dominant in Columbus in late December 2020 - early 2021.
According to scientists, mutations in the second strain are likely to make the virus more contagious, thus increasing the transmission of the disease from human to human.
Researchers stressed that they had no reason to believe that this would affect vaccine effectiveness.
In mid-December, it was reported that a new mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus had been discovered in the UK.
The United Kingdom authorities later confirmed that the version of the coronavirus detected in the country was spreading more rapidly and required greater caution from the population.
Although the new strain may be estimated to be 70 per cent more contagious than usual, there is no indication yet that it is more dangerous in terms of death or hospitalization.
