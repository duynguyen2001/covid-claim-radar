Immunity after a prolonged coronavirus infection begins to decline.
About how long the organism can be protected from re-infection, Vasily Akimkin, Director of the Central Research Institute of Epidemiology of Rosconsumpoversight, reported on Friday, 15 January.
Thus, according to preliminary studies, immunity after COVID-19 is maintained for three to five months, but begins to decline after the third, writes TASS.
"After an illness, immunity lasts for three to five months, then it starts to go smoothly," Akimkin told during a meeting with leading epidemiologists and virologists.
Previously immunologist, medical science candidate Nikolay Kryuchkov reported that there are five possible causes of COVID-19 re-infection.
First of all, he said, it should be understood that antibodies do not guarantee full protection.
Other parameters are important: the general state of the body and the presence of chronic diseases.
The latter can cause damage to the body's defenses and lead to re-infection.
We recall that Russian President Vladimir Putin said this week that it is time to move to large-scale mass vaccination of the population from COVID-19.
The Head of State has ordered the preparation of an appropriate timetable for the vaccination stations.
Last week Mikhail Vladimirovich (Mishustin - "Profile") reported to me that the industry not only met all the promised standards and volumes, but also exceeded the planned volumes of vaccine production.
We need to move from large-scale to mass vaccination, "the president said during a meeting with members of the Russian government on January 13.
