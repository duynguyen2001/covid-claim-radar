Cocaine as a defense against COVID-19: WHO told of the myths surrounding the new coronavirus
Myths and false visions of the new coronavirus.
The World Health Organization publishes official information on COVID-19.
MIF: Child urine is a COVID-19 preventive measure.
IFACT: Child urine IS NOT a COVID-19 preventive measure.
Details: Mocha does not kill viruses or bacteria.
Mocha may indeed contain small amounts of viral or bacterial material.
Hand washing or swallowing of child urine will not protect against the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
The hands should be regularly treated with alcohol or washed with soap.
Use conventional household disinfectants to treat surfaces.
MIF: Taking cocaine helps protect against COVID-19.
FACT: Cocaine intake DOES NOT protect against new coronavirus infection.
Cocaine is an addictive stimulant.
It has dangerous side effects and is harmful to health.
MIF: A new coronavirus can fly long distances
IFACT: coronaviruses CAN NOT be transported by air
Details: New coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a respiratory virus, mainly transmitted by air-droplet, i.e. by inhalation of droplets released from the patient's respiratory tract, such as coughing or sneezing, droplets of saliva or nasal secretions.
Due to their large mass, these droplets cannot travel long distances by air.
Infection may also occur by touching the eyes, mouth or nose after contact with the infected surface.
To prevent infection, hands should be regularly treated with alcohol-containing antiseptics or washed with soap.
I'll remind you:...............
An unknown coronavirus, COVID 2019, has been developing since December 2019.
Two months later, the virus began to spread rapidly in Europe.
On 3 March, the first confirmed case of coronavirus infection was reported in Ukraine.
The man returned from Italy in late February.
