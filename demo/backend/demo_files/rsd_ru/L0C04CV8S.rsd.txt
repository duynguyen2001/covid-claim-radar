The Australian journalist Sherry Marcson has called for an investigation into the origin of the coronavirus, stating that the United States Department of State has received a document on China's bioweapons research, The Australian reports on 10 May.
According to information, a document in the hands of the State Department stated that Chinese scientists had been testing the use of coronavirus as a biological weapon for five years before the outbreak of the pandemic.
According to Marcson, who studies the origin of coronavirus, a document entitled "The Artificial Origin of SARS and New Strains of Artificial Viruses Used as Genetic Bioweapons" was written as early as 2015 and focuses on China's research in bioweapons.
The document, on behalf of the People 's Liberation Army scientists and high-ranking officials, stated that the Third World War would be fought using biological weapons.
It has been suggested that the SARS coronavirus is the precursor of genetic weapons.
It is emphasized that the virus will cause disease in humans and can eventually be used as a fighting agent and spread at an unprecedented rate around the world.
The journalist noted that the paper also discussed the psychological damage that such weapons could cause and how cheaper their use was compared to land and air strikes.
However, according to Markson, there is no evidence that the virus was deliberately released.
Despite this, the journalist urged member countries of the World Health Organization (WHO) to insist on an investigation into the origin of the pandemic.
Little is known about the origin of the virus, which infected more than 158 million people during the pandemic and killed at least 3.2 million people.
