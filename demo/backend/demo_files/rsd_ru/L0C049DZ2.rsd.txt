The COVID-19 virus was created at the request of the Chinese government and released from the laboratory intentionally.
This is what the virologist Lee-Man Yan said on Fox News.
"Yes, of course, this was done intentionally," said Yan, responding to a question about whether she believed that the Communist Party of China "deliberately" released the virus from the laboratory.
According to the expert, she had been deeply involved in investigating the situation with the virus since the outbreak.
"I have my own data and evidence from my sources at the Chinese hospital, and I also work with leading world virologists," Yan said, quoted by the media.
"The virus was created in the laboratory and then spread all over the world, causing all this damage," she stressed.
According to media reports, Lee-Man Yan worked at a WHO laboratory in Hong Kong studying coronavirus.
She fled China.
According to the latest data, more than 29.7 million people are infected with coronavirus worldwide, and more than 939,000 have died.
It was first reported in December 2019, when people in Wuhan, China began to be infected with an unknown virus.
The outbreak was reported to have occurred in the ear market, where exotic animals were sold for human consumption.
From China, the virus spread rapidly around the world.
