Coronavirus can be carried on shoes and fly for at least 13 feet
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a new report stating that coronavirus can travel by air at least 13 feet (4 m).
This is more than twice the recommended social distance of 6 feet.
While WHO (World Health Organization) recommends 3 feet for social distance.
Studies have also shown that the virus can be stored on shoes and thus spread.
The conclusion was based on samples taken from the soles of the shoes of medical staff of the intensive care unit of Wuhan Hospital (China).
High concentrations of the virus have also been found on surfaces that are frequently touched: garbage cans, bedpans, and computer mice.
In the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University, as of April 13, 2013, nearly 3 million people were affected.
The number of people tested for coronavirus (190,882 in California) was nearly 93,000.
One person is in hospitals (just over 3,000 people are in hospitals in California).
The number of people who have recovered from coronavirus disease in the United States has also increased to 44,261.
Due to new research, it is recommended not to walk in street shoes around the house (it should be noted that many Slavs traditionally remove shoes when entering the house), as well as to wash shoes regularly with soap and warm water.
