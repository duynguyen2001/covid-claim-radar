In 2014, the United States banned the study of deadly viruses in its country, following several dangerous incidents in U.S. government laboratories working with viruses.
In violation of the moratorium in 2015, Anthony Fawcett (head of the U.S. National Health Institute), with the consent of then US President Barack Obama, funded the Chinese laboratory in Wuhan to continue research.
A grant of about $4 million was awarded.
In 2015, the laboratory in Wuhan also received money from both the Soros Foundation and some sources in France.
These generous grants were given to two laboratories of the Virology Institute in Wuhan, including the one where coronaviruses were studied.
It should not be forgotten that China and Iran have already accused the US of creating and distributing COVID-19.
And there are almost no answers about the origin of the coronavirus.
Scientists continue to debate whether the virus is man-made or not.
And new questions are constantly being asked.
For example, how could the US intelligence services alert the White House to a possible outbreak of a highly dangerous virus in Wuhan, specifically, as early as November last year, if the first cases were recorded a month later?
Did you know in advance?
Have you been hired by a time machine or hired by the modern clairvoyant?
This information was voiced by American television channel ABC, not Russian RT or "Sputnik," reports newsly.ru.
And what you 're going to do with other data that' s been published again in the U.S. media is that the Uhan Institute of Virology, which the US is now trying to claim to be the source of the world 's disaster, was largely sponsored by the US.
Why did the U.S. Department of Agriculture buy "pet parts" in Wuhan for toxoplasmosis studies?
In the end, Donald Trump had to open an investigation to determine the US's role in this predicament.
