Nikulin said that in 2015, the journal Nature published an article about a successful experiment by American scientists to modify the coronavirus of a Chinese flying mouse.
As a result of the modification, the virus was able to enter human cells directly.
The experiment was carried out at the Walter Reed Military Research Institute laboratory in Fort Detrick.
These experiments were described as extremely dangerous.
Nikulin recalled that, according to former German Deputy Minister of Defense Willy Wimmer, a modified coronavirus was patented in the United States in 2015.
The expert also noted that the first case of coronavirus infection in Wuhan was recorded on 17 November.
At the end of October, military competitions were held in Wuhan, in which about 200 U.S. soldiers participated.
According to Nikulin, the incubation period of the coronavirus is exactly in between.

Everything seems very logical.
