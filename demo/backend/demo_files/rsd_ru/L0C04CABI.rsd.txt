Researchers in California learned that coronavirus began circulating in China in October 2019.
Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, the University of Arizona, and Illumina have found that coronavirus has been circulating in China since October 2019.
This has been discovered using molecular dating, reports the University of California Press.
This method is used to estimate the frequency of mutations.
They also used epidemiological modelling.
In the study, experts took into account detailed information about the spread of kofiid in the Chinese city of Wuhan before the lockdown, the genetic diversity of the virus in the PRC, and the first descriptions of the infection that appeared in December 2019.
All this helped to establish the date when the virus began to appear.
Joel O. Wertheim, senior researcher and associate professor of infectious diseases and global public health at the University of California, San Diego Medical School, said that scientists had concluded that coronavirus began circulating in the province of Hubei in mid-October.
Until December, there were very few cases and no one noticed the virus.
According to Wertheim, the original strain caused the epidemic because it began to spread in urban settings - where the infection occurs faster.
The researcher questions whether the virus was circulating in Europe until December because even in the PRC there were units infected at that time.
European Commission spokesman Dana Spinant announced on 19 March that the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic had begun in Europe.
She said that vaccination should be accelerated.
The World Health Organization's representative in Russia, Melita Vuinovich, has suggested that the coronavirus pandemic is unlikely to end by the end of 2021.
She said that WHO had not yet observed a global decline in COVID-19.
And some countries, including Europe, are showing growth.
