Fact check: Was COWID-19 created by the US military laboratory?
false
The video contains many claims and theories, but the main one is that the Covid-19 virus was created at the U.S. military facility at Fort Detrick in Frederica, Maryland, in the summer of 2019.
It then spread (accidentally or intentionally) to China.
Covid-19 is a coronavirus and is therefore genetically linked to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), which caused previous outbreaks in 2003 and 2012.
So it 's not surprising that one of the many viruses that were listed for research in Fort Detrick was coronavirus.
The video says that the CDC conspired to conceal the outbreak of one of these laboratory viruses, attributing it to a "mysterious, volatile disease."
Although there is a mysterious "evaporating" disease that is puzzling to researchers, further research is needed, as "evaporating" has been widespread only recently, so all its effects on health are still being studied.
As we wrote earlier, although the origin of COVID-19 has not been confirmed, it is believed to be a virus of natural origin rather than a synthetic one developed in the laboratory.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), bats are the most likely environmental reservoir for SARS-CoV-2, and "all available evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is of natural animal origin and not an artificial virus."
