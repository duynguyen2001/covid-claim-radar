A new strain of coronavirus, more aggressive and contagious, appeared in South Africa in December, according to the country's chief epidemiologist, Salim Abdul Karim.
Scientists have found that the virus, called 501.V2, is easier to penetrate and more resistant to human cells.
Compared to the first wave, the new strain more often affects young people without associated diseases and leads to a more severe flow of disease.
In addition, it is about 50% more contagious than previous mutations.
South African authorities announced the discovery of a new type of coronavirus in late December.
The second wave of the pandemic was linked to a new mutation in the country.
In December, South African health minister Zveli Mhize stated that there was no reason to panic over the mutation.
As of January 18, South Africa, according to Johns Hopkins University, had 1.34 million infections and 37.4 thousand deaths - the highest number of African countries.
The "South African" strain of coronavirus has been found in several European countries - Denmark, the United Kingdom and France, as well as in Japan, the United States and some African countries - Kenya and Nigeria...............
WHO Director General Tedros Hebraeus had previously called the new coronavirus mutations a challenge for 2021.
He said that the World Health Organization was working with scientists around the world to understand how coronavirus mutates and how it affects its infectivity and lethality.
