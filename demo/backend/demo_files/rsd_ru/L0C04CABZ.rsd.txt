Coronavirus appeared in China earlier than expected.
The first cases started in November
In most countries with developed social relations, the increase in HIV infection has stopped, but we do not.
It is therefore difficult to project the dynamics of infection to our country.
As always, the contagion will come to us later, but to make predictions based on the scale and consequences will not take.
Thinking about our future, I would already quarantine all kindergartens with compensation to the mothers (Syria can wait) and transfer all schools to distance learning (every student has a cell phone).
It would introduce a draconian sanitation tax on hobbyists who gather staff for mass production meetings or concentrate in dozens in huge office rooms.
There is no alternative to the vaccine.

----- Fontanka, write immediately: by June there will be no sick people in the world.
