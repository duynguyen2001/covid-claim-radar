WHO has recognized that the "British" version of coronavirus is spreading faster than normal
Geneva, 8 January.
/ TASS /.
A new strain of coronavirus, discovered in December in the UK, is spreading faster than the usual variant.
The expert from the World Health Organization, Maria van Kerkhow, stated this at the briefing on Friday.
"New information is always available," she said.
- Recent data show that the conventional variant is not spreading as fast as the strain found in the UK.
And here we rely on the reproductive number, which has increased from 1.1 to 1.5. "
At the same time, Van Kerkhow stressed that the information available showed that there was no difference in how the virus spread.
"Accordingly, there is no change in how we should confront this option, including the use of personal protective equipment," said the expert.
- But we need to work harder to break the transmission chain.
This process is complicated by the fact that the usual version of the coronavirus continues to circulate. "
With regard to mortality and contagion, "there is no evidence that the option identified in the United Kingdom is more dangerous," she added.
In mid-December, British scientists reported the discovery of a mutated version of coronavirus that may be associated with the rapid spread of the disease in south-eastern England.
According to preliminary data, the new strain may be 70% more contagious.
