Immunity to COVID-19 lasts long, - Austrian scientists
For people who have contracted coronavirus, immunity from coronavirus has been..
This has been established by scientists from the Medical University of Innsbruck (Austria), Euronews reports.
Their findings were based on observation of the Ischgl ski resort, which has become one of the main centres of the pandemic in Europe.

People were surveyed in April and then in November.
After eight months, most of them remained immune to coronavirus.
We used several different antibody testing procedures to get the most reliable results.
It was found that 90% of the people who participated in the first study and came to the second study retained antibodies.
We also found that 70% of the respondents we examined for cell immunity still have cell activity, "said research leader Wegener Boren.
On the basis of the results, scientists concluded that the formation of collective immunity and the return of mankind to the normal pattern of life could occur much faster than predicted.
However, several key nuances must be observed.
With social isolation, with some measures that do not harm the person, and with vaccination of 40-50% of the population, it is realistic to return to some form of normal daily life.
If the Ishgl case can be extrapolated, apply on a wider scale, "said Dorothea von Lauer, Director of the Institute of Virology at the Medical University of Innsbruck.
She said that proof of this was the fact that the second wave of the pandemic in Ishgl was not as powerful as in the rest of Austria.
As OBOZREVATEL reported, a new version of coronavirus was found in the UK with mutations that allow it to evade the neutralizing antibodies produced by the human body.
And in Finland, scientists have identified a strain of coronavirus that is not always determined by PCR tests.
It has features of British and South African mutations.
