WHO: Cash can distribute coronavirus
The World Health Organization (WHO) has advised people to wash their hands and not use cash if possible, as bills can spread coronavirus.
The organization is advised to use smartphones to calculate the card, as a coronavirus (Covid-19) can be on paper money for several days.
The Bank of England has recognized that cash can carry bacteria or viruses, and encourages people to wash their hands regularly.
In February, China and Korea began disinfecting and insulating used banknotes as part of their efforts to stop the spread of the virus.
They used ultraviolet radiation or high temperatures for sterilization, after sealing them for 14 days before releasing them back into circulation, writes Fox.
It is not known how long coronavirus can survive outside the human body, but it is believed that in inanimate objects the virus can persist for up to nine days at room temperature.
