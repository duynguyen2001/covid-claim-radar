There is no precise data to support 100% claims that the source of SARS-CoV-2 was bats and pangolins, and that the Wuhan seafood market was the first and only source of the virus, the head of the Chinese delegation said at the joint working group of the World Health Organization (WHO) on the study of the source of COVID-19 Liang Vannyan at a press conference in Beijing on 31 March.
Bats and pangolins have been found to have infections that strongly resemble coronavirus.
However, this similarity is not sufficient to claim that we are dealing with the first COVID-19 carriers. "
, noted the expert, adding that minks and cats are equally likely to be the sources of the new virus.
Regarding the location of the coronavirus core in the Wuhan market, he believes that SARS-CoV-2 may have appeared simultaneously in several locations.
Wannyan also drew attention to the fact that no bats or other wild animals infected with coronavirus have been found in Wuhan and Hubei, as in other regions of China.
The question of identifying a "zero patient" was not ignored by the Chinese expert.
Liang Wannyan is convinced that this task is almost impossible, as the "zero patient" could be asymptomatic carriers of the virus.
It's a very clever virus.
The first one was found on December 8, 2019, but that doesn 't mean we found a zero carrier.
, explained Liang Wannyan, adding that the Chinese side would still continue the search.
It should be recalled that a WHO expert mission had previously published a report on the origin of COVID-19 after a visit to China.
Experts have not been able to determine the source of the virus, but have found it most likely that the virus was transmitted from animal to human.
