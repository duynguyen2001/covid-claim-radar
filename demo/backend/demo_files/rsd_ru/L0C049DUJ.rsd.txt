On March 10, 2020, an information petition to Fort Detrick was posted on the White House website.
The petition listed a number of notable events that led to the conclusion that Covid-19 was "the CIA's creation of a biological weapon laboratory at Fort Detrick in the United States."
In March 2020, a large number of English journalists reported the closure of Fort Detrick and the removal of a petition "showing 404 missing."
