I think the coronavirus was created by the government.
I think our good authorities created this cursed virus.
I think they infected people to cause some kind of chaos.
Some people make good money. "
The athlete openly stated that he does not like the way the US authorities handle the coronavirus outbreak:
If the economy doesn't recover, if people don't start buying and selling more things, and everything doesn't come back to normal, it will be a show.

It's easy to isolate them, while everyone else has to keep doing what they're doing.

In the UFC he won three victories..
Due to the global pandemic, three UFC events were postponed.
