The doctor assessed the effect of coronavirus water treatment
From the evening he started to breathe alcohol, twice at night, no cough awake, excellent condition.
And the edge burns the lungs..
You 're putting on expensive fuflomycin drugs.
Health, breathing needs 1 day, not more, with a frequency of 2-3 hours, then stop, otherwise the nose filth can be burned and the nose lotus, all necessary during this time the body will get in 24 hours (inhalation) If the nose filth has been badly damaged, don't worry, everything will recover in the fluid 2-3 weeks.
I try to breathe, it gets easier, I think I'll repeat it every three or four hours.
The first time I took a wool tampon, soaked it with antiseptic and put it in the right nostril from the beginning, and then in the left nostril, of course.
What do you think?
It has become easier to breathe and easier to live!
Good luck and no pain.

I've got chest pains, I'm breathing, it's easier to.
In short, if you breathe vodka, you will recover in a week, and if you do not breathe, in seven days.
Please tell me, how did you breathe, and how do you do it correctly?
Thank you in advance
All right, keep breathing and swallowing your mom 85%
Eat what is prescribed, who prevents?
Then compare.
I agree with you completely, it works, you just have to breathe when you 're sick, and for prevention, I don' t think it 's worth it, but that' s my opinion! Svetlana,
