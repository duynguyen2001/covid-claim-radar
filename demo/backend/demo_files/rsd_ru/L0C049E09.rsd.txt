The Philippines views coconut oil and its constituents as a potential treatment for COVID-19.
Coconut oil contains lauric acid and monolauric acid - 'first they cause the disintegration of the virus envelope, second they can inhibit the replication of the virus, third they can prevent the binding of viral proteins to the cell membrane' Coconut oil has also been studied in connection with HIV infection, patients to whom coconut oil has been added to treatment showed higher levels of CD4, CD8 and T lymphocytes than the control group.
Clinical trials are scheduled to begin soon.
We have already developed a research scheme.
Group 1 - control - standard treatment Group 2 - standard treatment and coconut oil Group 3 - standard treatment and monolaurin Group 4 - standard treatment and monocaprine Group 5 - standard treatment and SLS (?)
