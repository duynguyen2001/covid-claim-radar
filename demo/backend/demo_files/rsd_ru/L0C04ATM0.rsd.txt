Cases of continued immunity to COVID-19 have been identified after the antibody has disappeared
The body of COVID-19 patients is able to resist re-infection even if there is a decrease in the number or total absence of antibodies.
This was stated by a group of scientists from Switzerland and the United States following a study reported by Nature.
At the time of publication, the authors' findings had not been edited.
A survey of 87 people infected with the infection, after 1.3 and 6.2 months, confirmed a significant decrease in IgM and IgG antibody titres, IgA levels decreased marginally.
The neutralizing activity in the plasma decreased five times.
However, a number of specific B-cells that recognize the virus are retained.
If it occurs again in the body, these cells re-initiate antibody expression.
The study also showed a rather surprising result: the reactivated antibodies have increased activity and resistance to SARS-CoV2 mutations.
According to scientists, this fact indicates the continuing evolution of the body's humoral immune response to the new coronavirus.
- We have concluded that the response of memory B cells to SARS-CoV-2 develops between one and a half to six months after infection, which is consistent with the known duration of biological activity of antibodies, "the authors of the work reported.
It should be recalled that, according to several studies, neutralizing antibodies persist for an average of five months.
Scientists believe that the longest immunity forms in the superheated COVID-19.
