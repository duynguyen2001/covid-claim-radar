Plasma motor: Virologists evaluate new treatment from COVID-19
Russian infectionists believe that Chinese doctors' use of coronavirus-cured plasma can be effective
However, this method is not suitable for the development of a vaccine for the new pathogen.
A major drawback of the treatment proposed by the doctors in Wuhan is that the blood of those who have recovered does not undergo the necessary quarantine
, that is, it is not investigated for infectious diseases.
In Russia, according to current legislation,
It takes at least 120 days.
Plasma against the virus
Transfusion of blood components from recovered COVID-19 coronavirus has proven effective in treating a number of infected patients.
Zhang Dinyu, the head doctor of Wuhan Hospital, said this at a press conference late last week.
This is because in plasma (the liquid component of whole blood).
- "News") people who have been infected have antibodies that help to fight the virus.
Blood plasma works on the principle of passive immunity, Nikolay Karpov, an employee of the Institute of Biology of Tyumen University (participant of the program to improve the competitiveness of universities "5-100"), reported to Izvestia.
It contains prepared immunoglobulins and activated T-cells that are "configured" to fight a specific strain of the virus, "said a specialist.
The biological liquid itself is produced by doctors by centrifuging whole blood.
During this process, the denser particles of the substance separate from the less dense particles at the cellular level.
- Then the plasma is frozen, then stored in this form until the time of use, "the dean of the Faculty of Biological and Medical Physics of MFTI Alexander Melerzanov told" News. "
- Before introduction it is thawed and brought to a comfortable temperature.
Of course, transfusionists (doctors who are responsible for the compatibility of different biological liquids) are responsible for transfusioning products derived from blood.
- "News....".............
This is done in licensed health facilities.
Enhancement of immunity
After all preparatory stages, the plasma is injected directly into the blood by transfusion.
If a person who has recovered from the disease is used as a donor, his blood must contain specific antibodies against the specific infectious agent - COVID-19, said Professor Galina Kozhevnikov, Head of the Department of Infectious Diseases with courses in epidemiology and phthisiasis of the Medical Institute of RUDNC.
When such plasma is transferred to a patient with the same infectious disease at an early stage, specific antibodies neutralize the virus, leading to its inactivation and therapeutic effect, she explained.
In this way
10 patients have already been treated.
whose condition has not been improved by medication.
Medical doctors in Wuhan hospitals are now calling on those who have been treated to donate blood to help save other infected people.
Quarantine blood
However,
Chinese doctors are acting at their own risk in extreme conditions.
By global standards received from donors
Drugs should be quarantined.
As Danila Konnov, the head of the infection department of the university clinic H-Clinic RUDNH, explained in a conversation with "News", according to Russian legislation, a quarantine for blood that is going to be transfused,
It lasts 120 days.
- This is necessary to prevent infectious diseases
, - noted the doctor.
- The procedure is regulated by the rules for the collection, storage, transport and clinical use of donated blood and its components.
After 120 days of blood collection, the donor is again invited for testing for HIV infection, viral hepatitis and other diseases, said Galina Kozhevnikov.
This is necessary to prevent infection of the patient with immunotherapy by pathogens that may be in the incubation period for several months.
- If all tests are negative, the plasma obtained earlier can be transfused, "the infectionist stressed.

Passive immunization
Proposed by Chinese doctors
The treatment of coronavirus in microbiology has been called passive immunization, and it 's not new.
, told Professor Mikhail Shchelkanov of the School of Biomedicine of the Far Eastern Federal University (SHBM DOPU).
- It is worth remembering that each of us was "passively immunized" when receiving so-called colostrum antibodies against infectious diseases with breast milk.
However,
Given the level of information noise surrounding the new coronavirus, as well as China 's high population, we can witness unprecedented experience with passive immunization.
- told the expert.
There is, however, a danger that viruses will mutate and drift away, that antibodies will also act on some patients and not on others.
However, the head of the laboratory of genetic engineering of the MFTI Pavel Volchkov is confident that despite this, plasma drugs will be effective.
- The serum contains many antibody clones at the same time, so in this case the divergence of the viruses is covered by polyclonality - a mixture of antibodies isolated from the serum, said the expert.
However,
The usefulness of blood donations in general is questionable.
, Danila Konnov reported.
- In a number of cases, doctors have already tried to use the blood of patients who have passed the test with varying degrees of effectiveness.
It 's not very clear whether it' s appropriate to use a method in a weather that 's not very lethal.
, - reported the expert.
- It's not routine therapy.
First, the methodology is costly, and secondly, its application requires special monitoring.
All experts confirmed in a conversation with News that passive immunization is far from being a vaccine.

Penalties
On 17 February, the South China Morning Post reported 71,438 new coronavirus infections worldwide.
Of these, 70,548 are registered in China, 518 in Japan and 77 in Singapore.
The total number of deaths in China reached 1,770.
Five people died from the coronavirus outside of the country - in France, Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan and the Philippines.
On Monday, the first case of coronavirus in a Russian woman was reported.
She is among the passengers of the cruise ship Diamond Princess, which docked at Yokohama Port.
- The Russian woman will soon be taken to a hospital where she will undergo treatment, "the Russian Embassy in Japan reported.
The United States, Canada, South Korea, Italy, and Hong Kong announced that they would evacuate their citizens.
According to Interfax in the Russian Embassy in Japan, it is not yet planned to export Russians centrally.
There are no new cases of coronavirus infection in Russia, says Rospotrebnadzor.
From 1 to 16 February, 126 aircraft from China arrived at Sheremetyevo Airport, bringing the total number of passengers to almost 30,000.
After the escape of quarantine patients in St. Petersburg and Samara, the chief medical officer of Russia, Anna Popova, proposed to increase the punishment for such actions.
Senator Valery Ryazansky supports this initiative.
In his view, a full set of measures, including fines, should be applied to prevent potentially infected people from contacting healthy people.
