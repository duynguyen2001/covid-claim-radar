Who and why created COVID-19 coronavirus?
I think you forgot to wear it.
Man, get dressed, baranovirus doesn't sleep!
Mr. Virologist, you should ask what's the correct name for the virus you're writing about.
Covid-19 is the name of the disease.

Too many letters.
Who won?
Masons, as always
A lot of letters and nothing, at least for the first time, you could list more broadly the types of viruses that cause it, there 's about 10 of them...
Coronavirus is just one of them.
And not the most harmful.
And then, treatment, that is, the same antibiotic that was used in the replication phase - effective exposure, and then, yes, if you haven 't had the symptoms and the pill - it' s already tolerating.
Next, if you go to the WHO website and you see an announcement or a statement about this global epidemic, I don 't think so.
In Africa, Eola is officially present, and coronavirus is officially not.
And finally, copy the Zen articles... hmm... "and I beg you"
And as a matter of fact, no one has read the article. A lot of books, yes.
