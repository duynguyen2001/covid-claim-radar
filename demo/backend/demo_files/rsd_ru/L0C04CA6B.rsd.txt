Chinese scientists have suggested that the source of the coronavirus was wild animals.
Scientists from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention have reported that wild animals are the most likely source of infection of the new type of coronavirus 2019-nCoV.
According to TV 360, 33 sources of infection have been found in 22 outlets in the Huan seafood market.
"In 33 of the 585 samples from the Huan seafood market, nucleic acids of coronavirus were found and the virus was isolated from the environment samples," scientists said.
It turned out that there was a mixed trade in the Huan market in the city of Huan.
The products were not only products, but also animals.
This was the cause of the spread of the virus, which was found in 33 of 585 samples.
However, doctors at the local hospital also found that the first infected person did not visit the trade area, URA.RU.
The local edition of Xinhua reported that a ban on wildlife trade had been imposed in the country until the epidemic was completely defeated.
The situation in China is being exacerbated by the spread of an unknown coronavirus.
The city of Wuhan, where the first victim was recorded, is closed to quarantine.
Russian-speaking residents of the city spoke of precautions and the atmosphere of panic spreading in the country.
