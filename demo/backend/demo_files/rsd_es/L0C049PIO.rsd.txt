Two children run down a street in Nairobi, Kenya, in front of an informative mural that reads "Corona is real" warning people about the dangers of coronavirus.
The painting is located in the marginal neighborhood of Kibera, in the country's capital, and is part of an attempt to make the most vulnerable, sometimes the poorest, and you see unbelieving of what their eyes cannot see, understand the reality of a virus that has shown the ability to put entire countries across the world in check.
