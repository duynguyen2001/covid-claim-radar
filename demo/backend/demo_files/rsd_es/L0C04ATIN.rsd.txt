A group of Australian scientists has announced that people who have suffered from Covid-19 can develop an immunological memory to protect themselves from reinfection for at least eight months.
The study shows stronger evidence of the likelihood that Covid vaccines work for long periods.
This is the result of research led by Associate Professor Menno van Zelm of the Department of Immunology and Pathology at Monash University, with the Alfred Research Alliance between Monash University, Alfred Hospital and Burnet Institute.
The study was published by the magazine.
The publication reveals the discovery that specific cells within the immune system called memory B cells trigger a protective immune response through the rapid production of protective antibodies.
Researchers studied 25 patients with Covid-19 and took 36 blood samples from them from day four after infection to day 242 after infection.

As in other studies, which only analyze antibody response, researchers found that antibodies against the virus began to decrease after 20 days of infection.
But most importantly, all patients continued to have memory B cells that recognized one of the two components of the virus.
, spikelet proteins and nucleocapside.
These virus-specific memory B cells were present stable until eight months after infection.
According to van Zelm, the results give hope about the efficacy of any vaccine against the virus and also explain why there have been so few examples of genuine reinfection among the millions of people who have tested positive for the virus worldwide.
