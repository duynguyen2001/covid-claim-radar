Apple blocks update of UK COVID contact tracking app
A year ago everything changed, we were in the middle of a global pandemic, and we 're still in it - Apple was one of the technology companies that had decided to get involved in creating solutions to combat the pandemic, and something extraordinary happened: Apple was joining Google to release a code that would allow for the creation of positive contact tracking applications.
That was, in the end, using it at the population level was a decision of each government.
The UK decided to release its own app, an app that caused controversy and is now back on the lookout... Apple has blocked an update of the UK tracking app for collecting location data.
It has to be said that this blocking has not only done so by Apple, Google in the Play Store has also blocked the same update.
And it is that with the update of both privacy policies, it is now impossible for applications to collect location data without their consent.
Updating the COVID-19 contact tracking app would violate these tracking conditions according to the BBC itself.
Didn 't Apple and Google have gotten into this tracking thing?
right, what happens is that the UK was one of the countries that didn 't want to adopt the Apple and Google code, and hence a lot of the problems... The British health service has wanted to collect the location of the positives by COVID-19, it' s legitimate because many countries do it to control quarantine, but it 's not ethical to do it using Apple and Google devices.
It is controversial, but in the end all developers have to comply with the rules.
In the case of Spain with Radar COVID (using the code of Apple and Google), the app is practically nil, and the problem is that the autonomous governments are not providing the "positive" codes, and then there has been no great state communication for this app to be installed.
Unfortunately, technology is a great ally in a pandemic of these proportions, and we 're hardly using it.
