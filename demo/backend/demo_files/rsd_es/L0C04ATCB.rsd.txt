Found two new coronaviruses in frozen pangolin meat
The order of the leafhoppers, popularly known as pangolins, includes eight living species.
A leading evolutionary virologist working with scientists from China and other countries, Professor Edward Holmes, pointed out in a research in late March that pangolin was the most likely cause of the coronavirus pandemic, and now a group of Chinese researchers have provided new data.
The research team has published the results of the analysis of different remains of frozen pangolin in the scientific journal Nature, which were confined by customs authorities - due to illegal traffic of these animals - in late 2018 and early 2019.
The pangolin is the world's most trafficked mammal species....
The study's findings point to the presence of two new variants of similar coronavirus at 85.5% and 92.4% relative to the current cause of the global epidemic, SARS-CoV-2.
Of a total of 18 Malaysian pangolin specimens seized by customs in Guangxi Province, five of these animals have been identified with these new variants of the virus.
The pangolin is a mammal that is currently in danger of extinction and, according to
is also the most trafficked species in the world.
Pangolin scales are highly sought after in some Asian countries, such as China or Vietnam, where they are used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of asthma, rheumatism, or arthritis.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, in the last ten years annual catches have reached one million.
Currently, many studies point to SARS-CoVID-2 coming from a bat colony in Yunnan Province, although it is unknown how it reached the fresh-produce market in Wuhan, the epicenter of this unprecedented health crisis.
