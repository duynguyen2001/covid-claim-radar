The covid-19 was already circulating throughout Europe in November 2019, specifically in France, according to a study published earlier this month in the
This study challenges the theory that the pandemic began late last year in the Chinese city of Wuhan, specifically around the city's wet market.
"This report suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection may have occurred as early as November 2019 in France," says the document, signed by scientists from the University of Paris, the Sorbonne and the University of Aix-Marseille.
"In several participants we identify symptoms, background to possible exposures or specific events consistent with early SARS-CoV-2 infection," the research reveals.
The study, led by Professor Fabrice Carrat, director of the Pierre-Louis Institute of Epidemiology and Public Health for Inserm at the Sorbonne University, involved the collection of serum samples of 9,144 adults in the French population, of whom 353 had tested positive for covid-19.
Of these positives, 13 were sampled between November 2019 and January 2020 and were confirmed by testing neutralizing antibodies, French research reveals.
