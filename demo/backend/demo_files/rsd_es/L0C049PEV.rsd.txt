No, asymptomatic patients are not immune and can infect coronavirus
Thank you very much for the help, teaching the false information.
Excuse me and check the next one.
Excellent.
I think it's very good that you have control of the fake news.
I've always been conditioned that the asymptomatic patient is the one who doesn't have any of the characteristic symptoms of covid 19, but that if they can infect, it's not because they say I support the opposite.
I don't remember publishing that report, if I apologized, maybe I did it unconsciously.
ADEMAS DEBERIA TO PRESENT CIENTIFIC EVIDENCE TO DESERVE ALGO... IN THE REVIST NATURE OF NOVEMBER 20th A STUDY THAT THE ASINTOMATICS DO NOT CONTAGIAN
There are no arguments of scientific rigour q confirm q asymptomatic transmission of the virus, saved mosquitoes c vectors of a disease.
And there 's a couple wondering how it' s proven that the asymptomatic does transmit the incredible virus.
Maybe because a year ago we lived through the thousands of infections a day of people who had contact with asymptomatic, I don't know.
