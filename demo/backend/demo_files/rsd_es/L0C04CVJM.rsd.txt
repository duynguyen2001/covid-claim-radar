Treatment with statins could reduce COVID-19 mortality
Juan Carlos Cárdenas
One of the treatments that have been the subject of debate about their role in the evolution of COVID-19 has been statins.
This drug, which helps to reduce cholesterol in the blood and is used to prevent cardiovascular disease, is currently taken by one in four people, and is the drug most used by the general population.
Researchers at the CIBERDEM University Rovira i Virgili (URV) and the Pere Virgili Institute for Health Research (IISPV), led by group leader Lluís Masana, have now conducted a study highlighting the importance of not abandoning statin treatment due to concerns about the disease or during hospital admission.
The work, published in the European Heart Journal - Cardiovascular Pharmacotherapy, has shown that people who are treated with statins have a risk of dying from COVID-19 between 22% and 25% lower, after analyzing data from 2,159 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from 19 hospitals in Catalonia during the first wave of the pandemic, from March to May
To reach this conclusion, researchers took into account about a hundred clinical variables per patient such as age, sex, previous diseases, cholesterol levels, disease evolution or treatments used for COVID-19, among others.
Results support treatment
Thus, the percentage of patients who died in the group not receiving statin treatment was 25.4%, and 19.8% among those taking the drug, or 22% less.
Data indicate that one in five deaths were avoided with statin treatment.
In addition, if treatment with this drug was maintained during the period of hospitalization, the mortality rate would be reduced to 25%, thus preventing one in four deaths, "says Masana, who has coordinated the study from the Liver and Arteriosclerosis Research Unit of the URV's Department of Medicine.
"Statin treatment is not only shown not to worsen the course of COVID-19, but to significantly reduce patient mortality," adds Masana, who warns of the need not to abandon preventive measures for chronic diseases and health maintenance, such as statins
Even this fact has sometimes been recommended by faculty thinking its use could worsen the effects of COVID-19.
In the case of statins, we show that fear of the pandemic can never be used to justify the suspension of treatment, "concludes the researcher, who acknowledges that the door is being opened to analyze in another study to see if the administration of statins to COVID-19 patients could reduce the risk of death.
