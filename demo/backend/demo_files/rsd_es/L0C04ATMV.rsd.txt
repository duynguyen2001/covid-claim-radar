Long-term use of mascara produces hypoxia
Government lamecules dedicated to information censorship claim that this is not the case
It 's even enough to use a little common sense: when people inhale and exhale constantly with facial masks, they are recirculating part of the carbon dioxide they exhale, rather than receiving fresh oxygen from the air in their lungs.
Fresh oxygen is essential for q our body to function optimally.
Thus, for a mid-thinker, the prolonged use of masks seems to produce deoxygenation.
But let us leave the common sense and see if it is true, as Damned says, that "there is no evidence that it is."

As you can see, this study makes it clear that there is evidence of decreased oxygen in the blood after only 1 hour of use of surgical masks.
In addition, the decrease is greater in people over 35 years of age.
Imagine someone using it 8 hours a day.
But this is not all.
Another study showed that "wearing an N95 mask for 4 hours significantly reduced oxygen saturation and increased respiratory adverse effects" in patients with kidney problems during the SARS pandemic.

Some of these patients (19% of them) actually developed various degrees of symptomatic hypoxemia.
Therefore, it is proven that these masks can reduce our oxygen in the blood.

This other clinical trial study, conducted during the SARS pandemic, states that health workers "using N95 masks experience hypoxia and hypercapnia that reduce work efficiency and ability to make right decisions."
So, although it 's not yet a published study, we already know and we have multiple studies, like the previous ones, that support that mask-induced hypoxia influences cognitive function.
It is therefore clear that:
Prolonged use of SSI surgical masks produces hypoxia.
Oxygen depletion increases over 35 years

Newtrall and so on is ideal for confirming news... you don't know the favor they do you....
Well, you see, I'm wearing a mask, I have an oxymeter and a 99% mark. Listen... will it be that studios are shit?
Possibly.
Is this thread shit?
Sure.
If you wear thick masks, logically, you don't breathe.
But if you wear normal masks and you don't have epoxy, nothing happens.
It's easy, if you have oximeters do the test.

Oximeter?
counts
Try to do intense physical exercise with a mask.
It's very advisable.
Oxygen is overrated.
Masks and plastic walls, yes, that should work.
How did our ancestors manage to survive?
It's inexplicable.

Let it go, because it is impossible to reason with the tears.
When diseases like idiopathic fibrosis are on the rise in the medium and long term, the blame will be on anything but this stupidity of always going with your mouth and nose covered and swallowing some of the carbon you expel.
And the government and the health authorities because all hands will be washed.
Greetings.

That is because there has never been a virus as contagious, lethal, and dangerous as this one in the history of mankind.
The Black Death was a laugh compared to this.

A simple question is enough with a YES or NO.
Do you think that wearing a mask for a long time (several hours in a row) in places with high temperature and humidity (much of Spain, when summer approaches), generally (children, the elderly, obese people...) has no negative effect on health?
It's just to calibrate your level of government fanboyism.

How nice.
A relative who died of idiopathic fibrosis, plugged into the oxygen machine all day long, but those machines on the one hand give you life, but on the other hand they take it away because they give you oxygen, but they don 't get you to expel the carbon.
So every two by three to the hospital on the floor until he was able to get all the carbon out.
And the thermometer that we had was one of the best at 96-99 percent all the time... until the cumulative crisis came, it came down abruptly and then it was white, it was passing bitches and running to the emergency hospital.
It was back in a couple of weeks, an oxymeter to normal level and back to start.
And the mask is a simulation of being plugged into an oxygen machine, you breathe oxygen but you have more difficulty ejecting the dioxide, ejecting part but not all.
So obviously the side effects will take longer to manifest themselves than if you are plugged into an oxygen machine but they will arrive, I already assure you that they will arrive and the symptoms of hypercapnia that is what is called the abnormal accumulation of carbon dioxide and the secondary hypoxia that will produce you because it is not a dish of taste.
You will probably not reach the levels of my family (except that you are so stupid to be years old with the mask on) but if you take away quality of life that as an idiot and sub-normal you will blame it on age or anything less to its true cause, go hours and hours with your nose and mouth covered like a tard and a mongrel.
That day is when you have to come and call us assholes to warn us about these practices.
Greetings.

No, it's not enough with a YES or a NO.
The mask is something alien to the body.
The way to check whether it affects the amount of oxygen entering or carbon dioxide exiting NO is by using people, is by using an air-absorbing pump, with the mask as a filter, and measuring the composition of the air.
And you'd see there's no less oxygen.
Then why can that happen?
For something as simple as RESPIRING MAL, that is, doing it very quickly, so that the amount of oxygen you collect is less, because you get less clean air from the outside and you keep more air that should have been expelled (the air coming from the lungs).
If you want to have the same result as those people who say they have less oxygen in their blood, just hyperventilate, start breathing quickly with short air intakes, you 'll see the same thing happen to you.
Then, the problem is NOT masks, it is the idiocy of people who can't breathe properly because any slightest annoyance makes them mentally unbalanced.
But, of course, it is much easier to blame masquerades (hypoxia should occur in ALL people if that were the cause) than to recognize that there is a lot of street gossip loose.

They don 't claim that the mask prevents oxygen entry because the tissue prevents it.
Don't you see how doctors only carry it when they operate and little more?
if they were so innocuous, they would always have taken them all and every single one of the doctors.
Is it common sense?
