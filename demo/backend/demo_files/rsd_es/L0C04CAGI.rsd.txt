Madonna is censored on Instagram after spreading conspiracy theory about the COVID-19 vaccine
Madonna was censored by Instagram after sharing false information related to coronavirus.
According to the BBC, the singer shared a video showing a group of people talking about the COVID-19 vaccine conspiracy theory.
He also accompanied the clip with a message stating that the virus vaccine had already been found, but noted that it was kept hidden to "let the rich get rich."
The social network deleted the video by writing "false information," but before that the artist received endless criticism for her action.
Among them was the protest of pop star Annie Lennox, who commented:
This is crazy!
I can't believe you're backing this dangerous charlatanism!
Let's hope your site has been hacked and you're about to explain it. "
In the controversial video, we see a group called "front-line doctors," who are outside the United States Supreme Court building at an event organized by Tea Party Patriots Action.
In the clip, Dr. Stella Immanuel, a physician from Houston, said she had successfully treated 350 patients with coronavirus "and counting on" hydroxychloroquine.
The same video was shared by President Donald Trump, who also censored it, and was banned from tweeting for 12 hours as a penalty for sharing the clip.
