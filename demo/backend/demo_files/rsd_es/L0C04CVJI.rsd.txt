MEXICO CITY - Mexican doctors demonstrated the effectiveness of steroid ciclosporin A (CsA) treatment to reduce mortality from Covid 19 in patients with moderate to severe disease.
The pilot study involved 209 patients with SARS-CoV-2 who were hospitalized between April and May 2020 at an ISSSTE hospital in Puebla.
The conclusion is that ciclosporin A, used as an adjuvant in the treatment of steroids (methylprednisolone or prednisone) in patients with Covid-19, has been shown to have better results than those treated only with steroids, with a significant reduction in mortality, especially in those with moderate to severe pneumonia.
The study was led by José Luis Gálvez Romero, internist physician and immuno-allerologist of the ISSSTE Regional Hospital in Puebla.
Researchers point to the need for more research with controlled clinical trials.
"In view of the lack of effective treatments for Covid-19 and the public health crisis caused by the pandemic, we believe that these observations justify a deeper investigation through controlled clinical trials to determine the efficacy of the addition of CsA to the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection," concluded the authors of the study.
