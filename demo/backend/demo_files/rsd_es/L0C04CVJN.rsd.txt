Vitamin D reduces the chances of dying from Covid-19
According to a Boston University research, having enough "sun vitamin" could reduce the risk of suffering the worst symptoms of the disease.
Obtaining vitamin D reduces the risk of serious infections and the more complicated symptoms of covid-19, according to a study of more than 190,000 people by the Boston University Medical School.
According to the study, people with enough vitamin have a 52% lower risk of dying from the disease than those with vitamin deficiency.
According to researchers, vitamin D plays a key role in the immune system and can fight the disease.
Vitamin D deficiency is widely reported to affect the innate immune system and the adaptive system, and there are small studies suggesting the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and covid-19 mortality.
Studies conducted by the university show a strong correlation between blood levels with higher vitamin D and lower dose positivity for SARS-CoV-2.
We evaluated more than 190,000 blood samples from patients of all ages and ethnicities infected with COVID in the 50 states in the United States.
We observed that the higher the blood level of the patient of 25-hydroxyvitamine D, up to 55 ng / ml was their risk of becoming infected with coronavirus.
Color people have been particularly affected by COVID 19, "the researchers commented.
