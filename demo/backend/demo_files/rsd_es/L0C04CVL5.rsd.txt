Regeneron asks FDA for emergency use authorization for its anti-covid-19 antibody therapy, which Trump received
(CNN) - Regeneron reported that it applied to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use authorization for its experimental monoclonal antibody therapy.
This is the same antibody cocktail that President Donald Trump received this Friday after he was diagnosed with the virus.
The biotechnology company confirmed that it submitted the request for emergency use authorization (USA) in a statement on its website this Wednesday night.
"Under our agreement with the US Government for the initial doses of REGN-COV2, if a US is granted, the Government has committed to making these doses available to the American people at no cost and would be responsible for their distribution," the statement said.
"At the moment, there are doses available for approximately 50,000 patients, and we hope to have doses available for 300,000 patients in total in the coming months," he added.
Details of Regeneron treatment
Experimental treatment of Regeneron antibodies is still in large-scale clinical trials.
However, it has been available for compassionate use, which the FDA has to approve individually, as it did with the president.
"REGN-COV2 is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies (REGN10933 and REGN10987) and was specifically designed to block the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes covid-19," the company said in its statement.
"When you weigh the potential benefit against the risks, the disadvantages are very low here because we have seen no security concerns," Regeneron CEO Dr. Leonard Schleifer told CNN in an interview last week after Trump received an 8-gram dose of treatment, which includes two designed versions of immune system proteins.
Preliminary data from antibody treatment trials published last week showed that it worked fairly safely and with few side effects.
"This class of drugs is an extremely safe class," Schleifer said.
