Experts believe that the coronavirus is weakening
The coronavirus is losing strength, as demonstrated by a study by the Spanish Community of Scientists that indicates that the virus is beginning to slow down its reproduction.
Experts have revealed that the viral load found in the samples analysed from patients in recent weeks is much lower.
The so-called mutations can make the virus more contagious, but it can also become more vulnerable to the human body's defense system, becoming less dangerous.
So it 's good news, because the less viral load can exist in an infected person, the less chance it can be contagious.
That is, saliva droplets that are expelled by speaking, coughing, or sneezing contain fewer pathogens and the chances of infection are much reduced.
Since the early days of the pandemic, there has been speculation that the spread of the virus may be linked to climate factors.
