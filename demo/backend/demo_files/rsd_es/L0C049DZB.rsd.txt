By the way, in this other link they expand the recipe... now they talk about cocaine and BORROWING HORIZON.
People are worse than I thought.

It 's amazing what you invent to create visits on portals or to create unnecessary alarm in society.
The sad thing about all of this is that there are people who report for quality and real information, and there are others who, through disinformation, believe fake news.
We can compare it to the irrational ideas that we have many times in our mind, like, for example, nobody loves me, I 'm never going to be happy, everything goes wrong or I' m always wrong.
They 're like cells that tell us our emotional part and our rational part, we have to deny.
Thank you for your contribution @ martagon

@ martagon The truth is that it's very strong.
Did you know that Freud at another time also thought that cocaine solved mental problems?
In that case it was even worse, he was recommended to several friends and became addicted.
The worst thing about bulus (better than "fake news" because we have our own language that we don't value) is that there may be people who have come to believe it and consume it, even if it seems to us a lie.
