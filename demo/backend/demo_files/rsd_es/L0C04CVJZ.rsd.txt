WHO Celebrates DEXAMETASON REDUCES MORTALIDAD by Covid-19
Tuesday, 16 June 2020
The World Health Organization (WHO) today celebrated progress in the United Kingdom with the use of dexamethasone, a cheap and easily accessible drug worldwide, to treat critical patients of COVID-19, and congratulated Oxford University and the British Government on the discovery.
"It is the first treatment that has shown to be able to reduce mortality in patients with COVID-19 who required oxygen or ventilation," noted WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in a statement, who extended his congratulations to British hospitals "who contributed to this scientific discovery to save lives."
The Geneva-based organization echoed studies published this Tuesday by the University of Oxford which indicate that dexamethasone, a steroid, has reduced the mortality of respiratory patients by up to one-third and that of those who needed oxygen by a fifth.
The WHO noted that these good results have only been observed in severe patients.
Dexamethasone has been used since the 1960s to reduce inflammation in various diseases, including cancer patients, and since 1977 has been on the WHO list of essential medicines, so it is not patented and is therefore readily available worldwide.
WHO noted that it will coordinate results analysis to improve treatment information and will update its clinical performance guidelines for the care of patients with COVID-19, a disease that has affected nearly eight million people on the planet.
According to estimates by British researchers, if the drug had been available since the beginning of the pandemic, up to 5,000 lives could have been saved in the UK (where more than 40,000 died during the pandemic).
