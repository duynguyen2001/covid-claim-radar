Under-Secretary of Health Prevention and Promotion, Hugo L贸pez-Gatell, reported that the federal government has not ordered the cremation of the bodies of people who lost their lives to coronavirus, as it has spread on several occasions.
In an evening press conference, L贸pez-Gatell stressed that "cremation of the bodies is preferable, but not obligatory," as it is a recommendation that has been made in Mexico and the world.
He also noted that most families of the deceased have accepted the recommendation to avoid contagion; therefore, there is a high demand for cremations in funeral homes.
