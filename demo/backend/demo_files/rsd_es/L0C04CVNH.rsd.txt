Use of ibuprofen and other NSAIDs in COVIDE19 coronavirus disease
AEMPS Press Note on the use of Ibuprofen in COVID19
AEMPS reports that no data indicate that ibuprofen exacerbates COVID-19 infections
Date of publication: 15 March 2020
The Spanish Agency for Medicinal Products and Health Products (AEMPS) reports that there is currently no data to confirm an aggravation of COVID-19 infection with ibuprofen or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, so there is no reason for patients who are in chronic treatment with these drugs to interrupt them.
The possible relationship between exacerbation of infections with ibuprofen or ketoprofen is a signal that is being evaluated for the whole European Union in the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee upon request from the French Medicines Agency (ASNM).
This analysis is expected to be completed by May 2020, but with the information available it is difficult to determine whether this association exists, as ibuprofen is used to treat the initial symptoms of infections and therefore the cause-effect relationship is not easy to establish.
The fact sheets for drugs containing ibuprofen already indicate that this medicine may mask the symptoms of infections, which could delay your diagnosis and cause you to be diagnosed in more prosperous stadiums, although this refers to infections in general, not specifically COVID 19 infection.
The guides recommend the use of paracetamol for symptomatic treatment of fever as a first alternative.
However, there is no evidence against the use of ibuprofen in the treatment of minor symptoms.
In both cases, the drugs should be used on a case-by-case basis and at the lowest dose able to control symptoms.
AEMPS will continue to provide timely information to any new information on this matter.
The possible relationship between exacerbation of infections with these ibuprofen and ketoprofen is being assessed for the whole European Union in the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee.
Patients on chronic treatment with ibuprofen or ketoprofen should not interrupt it
The guides recommend the use of paracetamol for the treatment of fever as a first alternative, but the use of ibuprofen in the treatment of minor symptoms is not contraindicated
