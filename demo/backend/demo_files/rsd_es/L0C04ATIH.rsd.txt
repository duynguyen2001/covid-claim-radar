SPECIAL: Is COVID-19 like a seasonal flu?
BEIJING, 8 Mar (Xinhua) -- There has been a lot of concern and also disinformation about COVID-19.
While panic has occurred among some people, others have compared the disease caused by the new coronavirus to seasonal influenza, thus minimizing its severity.
In an interview with Fox News anchor Sean Hannity on Wednesday night, US President Donald Trump referred to the new coronavirus as the "flu crown."
At a press conference last week, he said that coronavirus "is like a flu."
Is COVID-19 really like seasonal flu?
How should we distinguish them?
First, the causes of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza are different, although their patients have similar symptoms, explains the World Health Organization (WHO).
COVID-19 pneumonia is caused by the new coronavirus, while seasonal influenza is caused by the influenza virus.
Because both patients have symptoms such as fever, cough, and nasal mucus, laboratory tests are required to confirm whether one or the other is involved, adds WHO.
Second, COVID-19 is a more serious condition than seasonal flu, which means that the death rates of one and the other are different, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained in a press conference Tuesday.
Worldwide, about 3.4 percent of patients with COVID-19 died.
Seasonal flu usually causes the death of less than one percent of those infected, Tedros detailed.
Thirdly, there is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19, when there are vaccines and medicines for seasonal influenza.
Clinical trials of COVID-19 therapies are currently being conducted and more than 20 vaccines are in the development phase, Tedros said.
Despite all these differences, the Director General of WHO emphasized that "COVID-19 can be contained and therefore we must do everything we can to contain it.
That's why the WHO recommends a comprehensive approach. "
