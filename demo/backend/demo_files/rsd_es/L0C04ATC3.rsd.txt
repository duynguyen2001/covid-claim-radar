A study places pangolin again behind coronavirus
A new scientific study again points to pangolin as the animal that caused the coronavirus pandemic.
This is a research led by Edward Holmes, an evolutionary virologist from the University of Sydney, Australia, and identifies these mammals as possible intermediate hosts for the human virus that is spreading around the planet.
The role played by pangolins in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of covid-19) is not yet clear.
However, it is surprising that the viruses of this animal contain some genomic regions that are closely related to the human virus.
The most important of these is the receptor binding domain that dictates how the virus can bind and infect human cells, "said Holmes in statements compiled by Europa Press.
Research officials have requested that the sale of pangolins and other wild animals in markets be prevented to prevent new diseases from being passed on to humans.
Pangolin, an endangered animal, is used in China and other Asian countries as food and for the creation of traditional medicines.
"Coronaviruses clearly have the ability to jump species boundaries and adapt to new hosts, making it easy to predict that they will emerge more in the future," says the research paper.
Other research
It is not the first study that points to pangolins as the being behind the origin of COVID-19.
Research by the Agricultural University of Southern China has already pointed to the real possibility that this animal could have been an intermediate host of the virus.
He concluded that the genome sequence of the new strain of coronavirus separated from pangolins was 99% identical to that of infected people.
