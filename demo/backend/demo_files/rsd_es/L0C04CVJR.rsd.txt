Lopinavir / ritonavir does not reduce mortality in COVID-19
The Internal Medicine Service of the Hospital 12 de Octubre has published, in collaboration with the internal services of other Spanish hospital centers, a letter in
about the use of
lopinavir / ritonavir and its potential benefits in the treatment of COVID-19.
lopinavir / ritonavir was used in the early stages of the pandemic because of its efficacy in the treatment of HIV, but without consistent evidence of efficacy.
Clinical trials have failed to demonstrate the benefits or risks, so researchers in this letter have conducted research from a large multicentre cohort (SEMI-COVID-19 Registry) that exceeded 8,000 patients.
This is the study with the largest number of patients analyzing this treatment in COVID-19.
Treatment with lopinavir / ritonavir was administered to 63% of patients, usually those in more severe conditions.
One of his main conclusions is that its use cannot be associated with a reduction in mortality, nor has its early use (median 5 days) shown significant benefits, so its use is discouraged in the face of this pathology.
