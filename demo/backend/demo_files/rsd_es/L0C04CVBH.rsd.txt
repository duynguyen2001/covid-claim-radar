The antiviral remdesivir from the US laboratory Gilead Sciences has not produced any improvement in patients with coronavirus (COVID-19), according to one of the first clinical trials in China that were broadcast prematurely and published by the Financial Times.
A summary of the test was released and then removed from the World Health Organization (WHO) website, according to the British newspaper.
There are multiple trials with remdesivir, as well as with other drugs, but the news of this failure is a severe blow to the scientific community, which had placed hopes for this antiviral in the face of the delay of a COVID-19 vaccine.
Disappointment also comes at a time when many countries are drawing up their plans for thinning out.
The Chinese trial showed that "remdesivir (...) does not improve the condition of patients or reduce the presence of the pathogen in the blood system," the FT stated, based on the document published on the WHO site.
Sources from the organization told the specialized site Stat that the study had been erroneously published on the site before being evaluated by a reading committee.
The test was performed on 237 patients at random.
Among them, a group of 158 were treated with the drug, and another of 79 received standard treatment.
The researchers also concluded that the application of the Gilead Sciences drug might have "significant" side effects, so they quickly disrupted the supply to 18 patients.
In addition to trials in China, remdesivir is also evaluated in the United States and Europe, in the large trial Discovery, whose results are expected soon.
