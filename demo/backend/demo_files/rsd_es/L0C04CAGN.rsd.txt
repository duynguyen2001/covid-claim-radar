Andreas Kalcker announces that chlorine dioxide is being used (successfully) in hospitals in Latin America!
Without a doubt, he is the man of the moment; the man whose truths have caused two million-dollar YouTube channels to close down like Mindalia TV and Pandora's Box and his book (now free) removed from Amazon.
The reason why the system has taken it with this Hispanic biophysical is quite simple: with the formula invented by Jim Humble (chlorine dioxide) cures the coronavirus in a couple of days.
And the system, not only does not want this cure to be known, but, at this point in the party, evidence that they have kept a cure for a virus that has killed tens of thousands of people hidden is a criminal offense affecting thousands of rulers, starting with the World Health Organization, to which Trump has withdrawn subsidies and is directly confronting it.
Among the interesting things he says in this video: that the police and the military are testing it as well.
(There is something going on behind the media scenes.)
Come on, Andreas!)
