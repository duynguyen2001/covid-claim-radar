The World Health Organization (WHO) has denied that cash and, in particular, banknotes transmit coronavirus and denies that those who touch them should wash their hands because covid-19 can "cling" to its surface for several days.
WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib has denied that her organization has said that people should be careful with cash to contain the spread of coronavirus and that it is preferable to use non-contact payment methods.
According to Chaib, this information was "misrepresented" by some British media, as the WHO "has not said that the banknotes carried covid-19 nor issued any warning or statement in this regard."
However, he noted that the population "should wash their hands after using money, especially if they handle or eat food" and that doing so "is a good hygiene practice" in general.
The spokesman for this international agency also stated that coronavirus can spread from person to person through small drops of the nose or mouth, which are expelled when an infected person "sneezes or exhales."
For this reason, he recommended keeping away from someone who had contracted the disease after touching an infected object or surface and then touching his mouth, nose or eyes.
