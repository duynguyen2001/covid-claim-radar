The disease was first reported in late December 2019 in Wuhan, a major city in central China, and has spread rapidly.
Since then, sick travelers from Wuhan have infected people in China and other countries, including the United States.
Using virus samples isolated from patients, scientists in China determined the virus's genetic code and used microscopes to photograph it.
The pathogen responsible for this pandemic is a new coronavirus.
It is in the same family of viruses as the known coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the coronavirus of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which have killed hundreds of people in the past 17 years.
