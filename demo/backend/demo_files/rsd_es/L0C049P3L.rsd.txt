Pancho Cavero: Pet hair can move coronavirus if you have contact with infected person
In an interview with the program Cuarto Poder, veterinary doctor Pancho Cavero warned that the dog, or pet, "does not infect coronavirus, but can behave like an object that moves."
Hair can carry the virus.
Like shoes, like clothes, like a book, "he added.
He noted that to prevent the pet from moving the virus through the hair, "you should avoid going to parks."
Stay in the garden where there is no dog.
Where there's only your dog, where there's nobody, "he said.
However, he pointed out that "in order for (your dog or pet) to get infected there would have to be a sick person, who usually doesn't come out and caress your dog."
He also explained that while dogs at the time they are going to do their needs are often used to going to the park or taking long walks, they "adapt."
I ask the people not to underestimate them.
If on the first day you don't want to (take it for a walk) because it doesn't give you the time, five minutes, six minutes. "
"The next day try again or at three days and the dog will adapt and, as soon as he sees the garden, will defecate," he added.
In turn, he recommended that he try to use the nearest garden to take out the pets.
The guy in your building, that one.
And picking up the feces, that's key, "Cavero said.
