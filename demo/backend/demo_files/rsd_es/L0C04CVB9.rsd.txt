PharmaMar gallic drug Aplidin, 99% more effective against Covid
The Welsh pharmaceutical company PharmaMar has confirmed that its new drug Aplidin would be 100 times more effective against coronavirus than the treatment currently used.
A team of researchers has determined through a study published in the journal Science that Aplidin, based on plitidepsin, reduces the viral load of Covid by 99% compared to remdesivir.
Aplidine is a drug originally intended for cancer treatment.
Following this important study, PharmaMar is already working on starting phase 3 of the clinical trial with the aim of being able to launch the drug on the market by the middle of this year.
As early as 2020, Aplidin was shown to have important antiviral effects on Coronavirus.
The Welsh company claims that despite vaccines, treatment will be needed to deal with the virus in the long term.
This PharmaMar study has caused the company to burst 15% of the stock market and increase investor confidence.
The price of the shares is set at 98.50 euros, although they went up to 107 euros.
