Malaria treatment is shown to be effective against coronavirus

A treatment with chloroquine, commonly used to combat malaria, has shown signs of efficacy against coronavirus, according to AFP director Didier Raoult of the Mediterranean Institute of Infections in Marseille (southern France), based on the results from a Chinese study.
"We knew that chloroquine was effective in vitro against the new coronavirus and the clinical evaluation in China has confirmed this," explains Professor Raoult, a renowned infectious disease specialist, commenting on the first publication of this clinical study by three Chinese researchers in BioScience Trends.
"Finally, this infection is perhaps the simplest and cheapest to cure all viral infections," says the director of this university hospital institute heavily involved in the detection of the new coronavirus in France.
The article published online on February 19 draws its conclusions from a clinical trial conducted in more than ten Chinese hospitals (in Wuhan - the epicentre of the epidemic - Beijing and Shanghai) to evaluate "the efficacy of chloroquine in COVID-19-associated treatments."
"The results obtained so far with more than 100 patients have shown that chloroquine phosphate is more effective than the treatment received by the comparative group to contain the evolution of pneumonia, improve the condition of the lungs, so that the patient returns negative to the virus and shorten the duration of the disease," Chinese researchers say.
The study does not quantify the difference in effectiveness.
"The antiviral and anti-inflammatory capacity of chloroquine could have a potential efficacy in treating patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonias," continues the article on the study by professors Jianjun Gao, Zhenxue Tian and Xu Yang, of Qingdao University and Qingdao Hospital.
In addition to its efficacy, "chloroquine is a cheap and safe drug, used for over 70 years," the article argues.
According to Chinese researchers, a 500 mg daily treatment of chloroquine for ten days would be sufficient.
