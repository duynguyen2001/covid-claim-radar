WHO visits laboratory in Wuhan
(CNN) - In a joint press conference with WHO experts in Wuhan, a Chinese health official working with the World Health Organization (WHO) team of experts in Wuhan, indicated that the Huanan seafood market may not be the first site of the COVID-19 outbreak.
"The Huanan market may not be the first place to have the outbreak," Liang Wannian, head of China's National Health Commission's (NHC) COVID-19 Expert Panel, said Tuesday.

Liang noted that the start date of the first COVID-19 case was December 8, 2019 and the first case associated with the Huanan market was December 12, 2019.
He explained that "the case with the start date of December 8 had nothing to do with the Huanan seafood market," but did not indicate a location to which he was connected with the December 8 case.

Earlier, WHO expert Peter Ben Embarek said that the team investigating the origins of the coronavirus in Wuhan had identified two scenarios that probably caused the transmission of COVID-19 to humans.
He also claimed that the virus came from an animal.
"Our initial findings suggest that introduction through an intermediate host species is the most likely route and a form that will require more specific targeted studies and research," Embarek said during the press conference.
He added that the possibility of transmission through trade in frozen products was also likely.
