Now it turns out that Remdesivir does nothing
They sold it to us as a panacea against coronavirus and it turns out that, according to the WHO eye you have, it doesn't do that.
Treatment with remdesivir has no significant effect on the survival chances of Covid-19 patients, according to a World Health Organization clinical trial.
This is a severe blow to hopes of identifying existing drugs to treat the disease.
Results from the long-awaited WHO 'Solidarity' trial, which studied the effects of remdesivir and three other possible pharmacological treatments in 11,266 hospitalized patients, found that none of the treatments "substantially affected mortality" or reduced the need to ventilate patients, according to a copy of the study submitted by the journal
"These treatments of remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and interferon seemed to have little effect on hospital mortality," the study found.
"We are aware that the initial data from the World Health Organization's (WHO) Solidarity trial was made public prior to its publication in a magazine," Gilead said in response to a request for comments.
The emerging data appear inconsistent with stronger evidence from multiple random studies that validate the clinical benefit of remdesivir.
For its part, the WHO has declined to comment, claiming that the results of the study were not yet public.
The WHO findings mean that the only drug that has been shown to increase Covid-19 survival rates is dexamethasone, a cheap steroid that can be taken orally and is widely available worldwide.
The WHO has recommended the use of steroids for patients with severe cases of Covid-19.

Yes, he does.
That family of drugs has been proven decades ago.
They know they fuck your health and cause symptoms compatible with the disease.
It's a plan without cracks.
If he does, he loads people with whatever other shit they put the coven sanbenito on.
Then they say it doesn't do much good because the bisho is too bad and ready.
