It 's a year from the origin of coronavirus, the global pandemic that changed our lives.
December 8 marks the first year of coronavirus in the world.
A fact that triggered a global pandemic that already leaves about 1.5 million dead worldwide.
A year ago, the first known case of coronavirus in the world was recorded.
On 8 December 2019, China reported to the World Health Organization that it had detected a "rare pneumonia."
365 days later, this "rare pneumonia" is named covid-19 and has caused about 1.5 million deaths and more than 60 million infections worldwide.
One year of start
Early hypotheses pointed to the Wuhan market as the epicenter of the outbreak, after it was discovered that a man was ill and his diagnosis did not respond to anything known at the time.
It was the tip of the iceberg.
From that moment on, daily contagion began to erupt in China.
It seemed to be something exclusive to the Asian country, but the arrival of December proved that it was not....
By 2020, the spread of the virus had spread to many other continents.
It was only a matter of months before the whole world discovered that a global pandemic had been unleashed.
One year of start
Wuhan has now returned to activity after the latest coronavirus infection was reported last May, and the World Health Organization continues with its idea of visiting this market and the hospital where the first cases were detected.
"We are working on it," says the organization's CEO, Tedros Adhanom.
We're planning it.
We hope to be there as soon as possible. "
Virus import
A year is a long time.............
Things have changed, and it is now China that reports that the virus has been imported into the country through food from other territories such as Argentina or Germany.
In addition, the country's health authorities support this idea, based on studies that confirm that the disease had developed in other areas prior to detection in goods from the capital of Hubei.
