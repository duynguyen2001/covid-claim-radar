A combination of antiviral drugs used to treat HIV had no beneficial effect on patients hospitalized with Covid-19 in a large-scale randomized trial, British scientists said Monday.
The scientists in charge of the "REUPERATION" trial at Oxford University argued that the results "convincingly rule out any significant benefit of lopinavir-ritonavir mortality in patients hospitalized with Covid-19 that we study."
Scientists found no differences in mortality, length of hospitalization, or risk of being connected to a respirator when comparing 1,596 patients receiving lopinavir-ritonavir versus 3,376 patients in a control group.
Kaletra from AbbVie Inc is a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir drugs used to combat HIV.
The company had increased its supplies while determining whether it could be used to treat the Covid-19.
"These preliminary results show that for patients hospitalized with Covid-19 who are not connected to a fan, lopinavir-ritonavir is not an effective treatment," said Peter Horby, chief investigator of the trial.
Scientists were unable to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of drug combinations in patients with respirators due to the difficulty of administering them.
The combination of lopinavir-ritonavir is also being studied in a World Health Organization trial.
