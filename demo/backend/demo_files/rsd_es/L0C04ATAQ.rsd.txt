Spain is one of the most permissive countries with masquerades....
The law in a magazine and in almost all European countries masquerades are mandatory in public places.
I remember that removing Sweden only in the UK, Switzerland were not mandatory.

What was the magazine, the Mark?
I think it was El Pais weekly or in the newspaper itself, I don't remember it well.
But I was quite surprised that it was mandatory in almost every country.

What magazine?

The fact that there were no masks doesn't mean you couldn't put on a house made of any shit or a simple handkerchief that was in any case also an effective means of reducing infections...
But they said they weren 't necessary, and even if I don' t remember correctly, they were counterproductive.
To go shopping... is that I think it's good
to go out on the street, to play sports or to the beach not...
