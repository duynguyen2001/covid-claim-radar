Immunity from Covid-19 could last years.
Despite these pandemic months hearing that the antibodies to covid-19 last only a few months, variable in each person, experts in the US say they could last for life or at least for a long time, as with other diseases.
It is the conclusion of a study by the La Jolla Institute for Immunology (California), specializing in immunology studies, a branch of medicine focused on the study, diagnosis and treatment of diseases related to the immune system.
When asked if we can be immune to coronavirus and how long that immunity lasts, researchers at this center have concluded that it could be for life.
This study, directed by Marco Werman, from the University of California, San Diego and the La Jolla Institute.
Among his findings, it is shown that 8 months after the disease, most people who have recovered still have immune cells to defend themselves against the virus.
These cells can persist in the body for a long time, perhaps years or even decades.
A lot of hope................
However, this study is still in question because it was published online and has not yet been reviewed by other scientists or published in a scientific journal, although it is the most comprehensive and far-reaching study on coronavirus-immune memory to date.
According to Shane Crotty, a virologist from La Jolla and co-director of the study, "that amount of memory" in the immune system "would probably prevent the vast majority of people from contracting a hospitalized disease, a serious disease, for many years."
Another amazing finding is that people who had suffered from SARS-like disease (severe acute respiratory syndrome), caused by any other coronavirus, beyond that caused by the famous covid-19, still have antibodies 17 years after recovering.
So far, the most optimistic conclusion was that of the University of Washington, which had found that certain "memory" cells after a coronavirus infection persist for at least 3 months in the body..................
