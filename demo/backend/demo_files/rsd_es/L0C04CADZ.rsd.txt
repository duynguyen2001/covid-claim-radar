Sweden does not confine the population during the coronavirus pandemic
People sit in a bar in Stockholm, on Wednesday 25 March 2020.
The streets of the capital of Sweden are quiet but not deserted.
As the coronavirus spreads across Europe, one country has taken a remarkably different approach to dealing with the pandemic.
In the capital of Sweden, Stockholm, you can still see people gathering and enjoying the spring climate.
Instead of enacting mandatory closures like its neighbors Denmark and Norway, the Swedish government has made recommendations to the public, including social estrangement and work from the home, while urging those over 70 to isolate themselves.
Restaurants and elementary schools have remained open while meetings have been limited to 50 people since Sunday, which remains enough to spend time with friends.
Swedish health authorities argue that other countries, such as Italy or Spain, have been too draconian, as Swedish Public Health Agency State Epidemiologist Anders Tegnell explains.
I mean, if you do very drastic things like in some other countries.
I mean, it's not possible to keep schools closed for four or five months that would have drastic effects in many ways, especially on public health. "
But with 3,700 cases and more than 100 deaths by Sunday - the approach has been met with skepticism by some health authorities.
The journal of the Swedish Medical Association published a warning document about its dangers and a medical expert said that the government was playing Russian roulette with its population, citing the lack of scientific evidence behind its approach.
