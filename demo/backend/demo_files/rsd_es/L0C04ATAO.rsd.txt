Minister of Health: Masquerades are not compulsory in classrooms
Despite the reintroduction of the requirement to use masts in indoor spaces, classrooms are being saved from the rule, Health Minister Adam Vojtch said this Wednesday.
However, private sector employees working in offices must cover their faces from Thursday onwards, with the exception of those working in a space, for example in the office, with a minimum distance of two metres from their colleagues.
Vojtch said that coronavirus has been confirmed in 144 schools since the beginning of the school year on September 1.
Other exceptions to the masquerade rule will be children's gardens, as well as for people with mental disabilities, for people who consume food and drink and for athletes during training and competitions, according to the Minister of Health.
