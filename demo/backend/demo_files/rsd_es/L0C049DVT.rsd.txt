Chinese blame Bill Gates for COVID-19
Indigenous people from the municipality of Las Margaritas in Chiapas marched this week to demand improvements in health services, equipment and inputs, accusing that "coronavirus was invented and funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Jhonson and Jhonson."
Tojolabales and tzeltales were called on social networks by the group Luz y Fuerza del Pueblo de Chiapas to participate in a demonstration for the arrival of the Covid-19 and entered the municipal seat expressing their disagreement.
According to the group's Facebook account, the Gates are accused of inventing and financing the virus as a measure in support of reigning capitalism.
In one of the published photographs of the march that convened this organization, the indictment can be read.
They also accuse Covid-19 of being designed to kill people over 60 who "interfere" with the interests of capitalism.

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a charity that aims to eradicate poverty and invest in education and health programs worldwide.
In recent weeks, scientists and researchers have been sponsored through this foundation to create an effective vaccine against most types of influenza.
This is not the first time in Chiapas that people are protesting against Covid-19 because of mistaken ideas, avoiding campaigns to sanitize or eradicate the mosquito that causes dengue, for fear of being infected.
