Dr. Eduardo Gotuzzo, a member of the Committee of Experts of the Ministry of Health, noted that the use of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin in early stages of coronavirus and as part of ambulatory treatment in patients at risk is a "serious and safe" alternative.
Gottuzzo stated that hydroxychloroquine has 126 studies registered in international programs and is a very useful drug in rheumatic diseases because of its anti-inflammatory effects, while ivermectin was used in the world more than 40 years ago and is the most used, after aspirin.
"These international experiences ensure a high level of safety in ambulatory patients," he said.
Gotuzzo added that, in hospitalized patients, there are also controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies that concluded that these drugs are not associated with a difference in overall mortality in hospitalized patients.
Finally, he clarified that the study published in the British medical journal The Lancet on the harmful effects of hydroxychloroquine on hospitalized patients would have presented incorrect data, generating much worldwide noise.
