Influenza vaccine does not transmit Covid-19
Fake news and information from inadequate sources have created difficulties in properly developing vaccination processes in several areas of the department.
False beliefs such as paying money for each coronavirus-carrying patient and intentionally injecting coronavirus are some of the thoughts that have prevented the community from being vaccinated and protected from other diseases.
The situation has been evidenced by several health workers, among them Andr√©s Mauricio Betancur, manager of the Manzanares hospital.
In the field, there 's more evidence of false beliefs, believe that we' re paid 30 million for every patient with coronavirus, and that 's why we inject it through vaccines.
There are people who still with academic training think that which is false, "Betancur commented.
The Territorial Directorate also dismisses this information and asks not to trust it, as it has consequences for communities.
We call on them to vaccinate, because that takes care of us not only of influenza but also of other diseases.
If we are healthy, we are less likely to have to visit a care center where covid-19 is more likely to be, "said Alba Arboleda, coordinator of the DTSC's Immunization Plan.
It should be remembered that vaccination processes are free, and that people can go to their EPS for their immunization processes either in person or at home, if the entity to which they are affiliated so provides.
In addition, the Territorial Health Directorate reiterates that hospitals have differentiated care routes for those suspected of coronavirus infection and those who come for other reasons.
