In addition, the expert detailed in 24 Hours Central that it is not necessary to use it if you do not encounter symptoms, as the entity announced this Monday that there is no likelihood of air-borne infection.
This Monday, the representative of the World Health Organization, Fernando Leanes, explained in a new edition of 24 Horas Central, the recent publication of the organization indicating that COVID-19 is not transmitted by air.
In this sense, Leanes explained that the use of masks is not necessary unless there are symptoms and that those who use them must use them "with minimal training," which should be provided by a doctor.
If I use a mask I touch the mask without washing my hands before I contaminate it.
If you use it without being trained I will be trusted and have problems.
If I'm standing next to a person who has coronavirus and their droplets fall on the mask and touch that's another problem, "the expert explained.
