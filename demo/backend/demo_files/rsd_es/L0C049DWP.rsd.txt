Coronavirus Conspiracies
There are many theories about the coronavirus, most of which are conspiracy theories because, although it has not yet been said exactly what was the source of the virus, the long-circulating one was due to the ingestion of bat soup.
Many of the media already say that it was created in a laboratory and that it did not come from a bat that infected a puke and then infected a woman, which is another of the theories that circulate.
However, there are other theories that, although they sound disjointed, may not be so incoherent.
Like that of the Clinton and Bill Gates, it is said that the first and Bill Gates funds financed the virus in China so that the pandemic could spread around the world and so that all people would accept the vaccine that would bring the nanoscale microchips developed in China as well.
These microchips are said to be so small that they enter the tip of a sewing machine needle, so that no one will realize that they already have them when the vaccine is put in place, but through them all people will be more vulnerable to certain diseases and their behavior and consciousness can be controlled.
Although the idea seems to have no feet or head, it has never before been global where there have been so many deaths and the instability of the economy arose by chance, everything has been planned.
In fact, there are celebrities who believe that the disease arose to put the chip on everyone, such as the famous biologist Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai who has officially said in public that that plan was organized by the Clintons and the tycoon.
But as always, those are just some theories, and it's in you what you think do your own research and believe what your heart tells you.
