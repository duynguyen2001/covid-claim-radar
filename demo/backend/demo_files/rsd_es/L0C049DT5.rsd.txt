Singer fined for spreading the rumor that marijuana cures COVID
Hsieh Ho-hsien, a Taiwanese singer, has been fined about 1,800 euros for sharing an image on Instagram that read "The yerba kills the Covid."
The message was sent in February, when the pandemic was at its worst in China.
According to Hsieh, he echoed another message he received from a European friend who sent him in early February 2020 that cannabis was capable of killing Sars-Cov-2.
The prosecution accused him of having shared this message again without verifying it.
The formal charge, as one might expect, is that Hsieh arbitrarily shared false information causing panic at a time when a pandemic was in place.
The resolution is unworkable and Hsieh will have to pay.
It's not much, it's all said.
Hsieh was arrested in December 2019 for carrying marijuana.
His wife accused the police of carrying a mandanga on him, and he was caught.
But that 's another story.
