A group of researchers at Harvard Medical School in Boston, U.S.A., has highlighted the possibility that the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes Covid-19 disease may have begun to circulate through the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the pandemic, since last August.
One claim they make after analyzing satellite images of the parking lots of major hospital centers in Chinese cities, as well as increasing Internet searches related to symptoms that we now know are attributable to coronavirus.
Last August saw an increase in visits to hospital centres, with a special focus between September and October, culminating in a peak in December.
Based on these analyses, researchers point out that the virus may have been circulating months before the first cases occurred.
In this sense, they indicate that, if these findings were confirmed, the "wet market" considered to be the origin of the current pandemic would only have been the beginning of an outbreak since the virus had already been in circulation in the city long before.
Research based on satellite imagery reveals that since last August there has been an increase in visits to hospital centres, with a special concentration between September and October, culminating in a peak in December.
During this same time period, network searches for symptoms associated with Covid-19 such as cough and diarrhea were launched.
Researchers point out that these findings cannot be directly related to coronavirus, but help reinforce other studies that attempt to demonstrate that coronavirus was already circulating in Wuhan long before the detection of the first cases.
