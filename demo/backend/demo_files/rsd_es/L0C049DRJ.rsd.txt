Whoa!
Bicarbonate lemon does not cure covid-19
Since the beginning of the pandemic there have been many blogs circulating through social networks about the origin, prevention, transmission, healing, and a long one on covid-19.
Moreover, according to events, fake news was being tailored to the impact it would have on the population.
One of the cells that circulated at the time was to make us believe that covid-19 could be cured with lemon and bicarbonate.
This fake remedy is back on the grid and WhatsApp.
The story begins by stating that there is a cure for SARS-CoV-2.
It is a question of mixing bicarbonate and lemon and drinking it as a cup of tea, a practice very common in Israel, precisely a country where, they state in the bowl, safety measures have been allowed to be relaxed because this practice has made no cases of covid-19, which is again false as the number of new infections in Israel is increasing, 859 new cases in 24 hours, according to the newspaper El Mundo in the last 24 hours have occurred.
The bulo says that by drinking this drink every afternoon, "the action of the lemon with hot sodium bicarbonate kills the virus immediately, removing it from the body.
These two components alkalize the immune system, as at nightfall the system becomes acidic and the defenses diminish. "
The message was denied by Bolivia Verifa (@BoliviaVerif1ca) and, in Spain, Joan Carles March (@joancmarch), co-director of the Andalusian School of Public Health, on the portal Salud Sin Bulos (@SaludsinBulos), reminded that vitamin C supplements do not reduce the risk of coronavirus or colds.
