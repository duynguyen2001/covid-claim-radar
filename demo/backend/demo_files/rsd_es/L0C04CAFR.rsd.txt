Government of Norway suspends COVID-19 contact tracing app
The Norwegian government stopped the operation of coronavirus contact tracing application, after the Norwegian Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) noted that due to the decrease in the number of infections, the invasion of people's privacy was no longer justified.
According to
, the app will stop collecting new data and all information that has already been collected will be deleted, while its operation will be suspended indefinitely.
The Norwegian government's decision to suspend its contact tracking app is in line with a joint statement by civil society, signed by dozens of organizations around the world, stating that the expansion of the state's surveillance powers to combat COVID-19 should be limited in duration and only extended for the strictly necessary time.
So far, it is unclear how effective these apps have been or will continue to be in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.
On the contrary, there are many concerns about the use of these surveillance tools.
UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, David Kaye, warned in his most recent report that, while there is a legitimate desire to track contagion and transmission, it should not be forgotten that there are many examples in recent history of extensive and excessive use of surveillance, directed or massive, that does not meet human rights standards.
For Kaye, the use of these technologies must comply with various principles consistent with human rights, such as that authorizations for surveillance must be contained in accessible and public laws; authorization for surveillance of specific individuals must be based on independent evaluation; there must be a rigorous record of surveillance that can be consulted subsequently; some personal data should be expressly excluded from the collection, such as the content of private communications, among others.
One of the main concerns is that many states' increased surveillance capabilities for this disease persist many years later to monitor citizens, as is happening in China, where there is little clarity about the temporal limits of the use of tracking applications.
Even some local authorities are evaluating how to maintain these apps despite their invasive nature.
