Simon points to the visons as the possible origin of coronavirus.......
The visons could be an original reservoir of coronavirus, according to Fernando Simón.
The director of the Centre for the Coordination of Health Warnings and Emergencies (CCAES), Fernando Simón, has pointed out that visons could be the original reservoir of the virus covid-19, following a possible first infection of visons to humans on a farm in the Netherlands.
However, the epidemiologist has pointed out that this extreme should be confirmed by studies.
According to research by the Dutch health authorities, there has been a transmission of the new coronavirus from vison to humans.
Research has also shown that vison with covid-19 can be asymptomatic.
The virus found in a staff member of a mink farm showed similarities to that found in the mink on that farm.
Based on this comparison and the position of this form of the virus in the genetic tree, the researchers concluded that it is likely that a farm staff member was infected by the vison.
No Animal to Human Transmission in Spain
In a press conference following the Coronavirus Management Committee, the epidemiologist has highlighted that, for the time being, no animal-to-human transmission has been reported in Spain, and that if there has been, "it has gone unnoticed."
Simon believes this infection in the Netherlands may be a "sporadic situation," but he sees this case as "very interesting" to find out what the original reservoir of the virus might be, which according to several studies could involve bats and pangolins.
In other coronaviruses, specifically SARS, the reservoir was the civets.
And that the visons have been infected could indicate that they could be the original reservoir of the pathogen in China, "Dr. Fernando Simón has conjectured.
