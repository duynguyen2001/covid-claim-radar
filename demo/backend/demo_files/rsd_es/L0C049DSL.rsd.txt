Bill Gates responds to conspiracy theories linking him to COVID-19.

Proponents of this theory are convinced that the American magnate wants to implant microchips to the rest of the population to impose a new world order alongside Warren Buffett.
"It's very difficult to deny this, because it's so stupid and strange that even repeating it almost gives it credibility," added the famous entrepreneur, who stressed that conspiracy theories are "so bizarre that you want to perceive them as something funny, but really it's nothing funny."
The philanthropist also stressed that fighting epidemics and mass vaccinations requires "necessary systems," such as health records, but have nothing to do with microchips.

Gates also expressed hope that the world would "collaborate in the development of safe and effective vaccines" that "can reach those who need them most, not necessarily those who can pay most."
