Young man says coronavirus isn't real... because humans don't exist!
This young man joins skeptics who indicate that coronavirus does not exist, so they do not follow sanitary measures.
Despite the number of deaths currently recorded in Mexico, some still believe that covid-19 does not exist.
The reality is that both the infected and the dead continue to accumulate in our country, and that skeptics also continue to be present without following the recommended health measures to prevent increases in both the dead and the dead.
This was recently proven with a story that went viral on social media through a video, as a young man who was being interviewed by a reporter indicated that coronavirus does not exist because... we humans don't exist!
In late June, actress Paty Navidad stated that "coronavirus is a virus created by pharmaceuticals as part of the dark elite plan, method of mass control and population reduction," adding that "one of the forms of genocide is to create epidemics, 'natural' disasters and exterminate much of humanity."
Now, through an interview, a young man who was interviewed by a reporter in Colombia said he didn 't use covers because coronavirus is not real.
"The truth in the covid I don't believe, none of this is real, we don't exist, all this is a pastime," the boy said before the stunned look of the reporter.
In the video you can see how the young man says he will not be cared for not so much because coronavirus does not exist but because for him, human beings do not exist.
The Colombian health authorities themselves, upon learning of the existence of this video, invited the population to continue to follow the health recommendations to prevent the increase of coronavirus infections and deaths.
