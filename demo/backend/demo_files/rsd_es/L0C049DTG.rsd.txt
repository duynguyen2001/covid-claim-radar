A mistake could be the origin of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a Nobel Prize in Medicine
The 2008 Nobel Prize in Medicine is awarded to virologist Luc Montagnier, who argues that coronavirus  was created in a laboratory and that it was infected by a "mistake."
The scientist considers it "impossible" that SARS-CoV-2 originated spontaneously.
That Covid-19 appeared after contamination in a wild animal market is a good legend.
The virus came out of a Wuhan laboratory. "
These have been his statements, made to and published by the web
Why doctor?
, in which he also defends the good scientific doing of the Chinese community.
"Chinese scientists are great specialists," he has assured, though he thinks that a "mistake" has caused this virus to spread, causing more than 188,000 positive cases in Spain and about two million worldwide -- so far.
Virus "manufactured" in China
Montagnier has revealed that he has "analyzed," along with mathematician Jean Claude Perrez, details of "the sequence of discovery and propagation of Covid-19" and consider it "could have been fabricated," although he does not clarify whether wholly or partially.
He also argued that the spread of pandemic disease could have been a human, technical, or scientific "failure."
According to Montagnier, the scientists working in Wuhan's laboratory are "great specialists in coronaviruses" and details that research on this virus type dates back to "early 2000."
HIV Research
Montagnier was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his role in the discovery and isolation of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is responsible for AIDS.
He shared the merit with fellow scientist Françoise Barré-Sinoussi - also discoverer of the HIV- and with the German Harald zur Hausen.
The latter discovered the human papilloma virus, which causes sexually transmitted diseases and cervical cancer.
