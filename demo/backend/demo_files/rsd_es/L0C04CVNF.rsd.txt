The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and diclofenac, is not associated with any adverse effect in people with Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, according to a study conducted by researchers from the University of Southern Denmark, Aarhus University Hospital and the Danish Medicines Agency.
During the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, the possibility arose that the use of ibuprofen analgesics could lead to a more severe course of coronavirus disease.
Since the use of ibuprofen and other NSAIDs is widespread, data on their safety are urgently needed to guide doctors and patients.
In the new study, published in the journal 'PLOS Medicine', researchers obtained data on 9,326 Danish residents who tested positive for Covid-19 between 27 February 2020 and 29 April 2020.
Data showed use of NSAIDs, 30-day mortality, hospitalization, ICU entry, mechanical ventilation, and acute renal replacement therapy.
Researchers found no association between any of the results and the use of NSAIDs.
In addition, among NSAID users in a matched cohort that tested positive for coronavirus, 6.3 percent died, 24.5 percent were hospitalized, and 4.9 percent entered ICU.
Of those who tested positive for coronavirus but were not treated with NSAIDs, 6.1 percent died, 21.2 percent were hospitalized, and 4.7 percent entered the ICU.
None of these differences between the groups were statistically significant.
Given the available evidence, there is no reason to withdraw the well-indicated use of NSAID during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
However, the well-established adverse effects of NSAIDs, in particular their renal, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular effects, should always be taken into account, and NSAIDs should be used at the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time for all patients, "experts said.
