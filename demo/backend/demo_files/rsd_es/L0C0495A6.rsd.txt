Bill Gates responds to conspiracy theories that accuse him of spreading coronavirus.
According to the co-founder of Microsoft, those who believe in these theories want to find "a very simple explanation," so they look for "a villain" to blame for the pandemic.

US billionaire and philanthropist Bill Gates has spoken out on conspiracy theories accusing him of being behind the coronavirus pandemic and expressed hope that these speculations will lose their strength.
Gates noted in an interview with CNN that his charity foundation is spending more money on fighting covid-19 than any other organization in the world.
However, in the minds of conspiracy theorists, the situation turns around and points to the tycoon, accusing him of wanting to kill them through the vaccines.
According to the co-founder of Microsoft, these conspiracy theories are the result of "a bad combination of pandemic, social networks, and people looking for a very simple explanation" of what is happening in the world, which makes the figure of "a villain" focus on simply explaining the pandemic's appearance.
In June, the billionaire lamented the existence of many "false rumors" and "unscientific things."
"It is worrying that at times like this [...] there is so much madness," he said in relation to conspiracy theories accusing him of being behind the pandemic to insert microchips into people's organisms under the pretext of a vaccine in order to implement a massive surveillance plan for humanity.
"When we have the vaccine, we will want to develop group immunity to cover more than 80% of the population," the businessman said, reiterating that the drug's development "has nothing to do with" microchips.
