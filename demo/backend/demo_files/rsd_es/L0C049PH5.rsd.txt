Breast-feeding does not transmit Covid-19 to babies and does give antibodies to the virus
(EUROPA PRESS)
A study by researchers at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC), in collaboration with several other universities, has shown that women with Covid-19 who breastfeed do not transmit coronavirus to their children, but antibodies that can neutralize the virus.
In her work, published in the magazine 'mBio', she analyzed 37 milk samples sent by 18 women diagnosed with COVID- + 19.
None of the milk samples contained the virus, while almost two-thirds of the samples contained two virus-specific antibodies.
Fundamentally, this study provides evidence that mothers positive to COVID-19 should not be separated from their newborn children.
We only want to kidnap a mother of her baby if it's medically necessary.
These early results suggest that the breast milk of mothers who have been infected with COVID-19 contains specific and active antibodies against the virus, and that they do not transmit the virus through milk, "said experts.
And that is, they have found high levels of IgA, a common antibody in blood and other body fluids, in breast milk.
IgA migrate in mucous transfer, so it is an "encouraging" information that mothers transfer these antibodies.
