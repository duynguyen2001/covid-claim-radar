Coronavirus: Is it true that ibuprofen exacerbates COVID-19 symptoms?
Ibuprofen
Early in the pandemic, some health agencies suggested that anti-inflammatory drugs, such as the popular ibuprofen, could be associated with a more severe picture of coronavirus.
A recent study sheds more light on this link.
A team of British researchers analyzed data from 72,000 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized between January and August 2020, some of whom took non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and concluded that the mortality rate was similar for both groups of patients (31.3% and 30.4%, respectively).
The use of antiinflammatory drugs was also not associated with the severity of the disease.
Ibuprofen is safe for patients with COVID-19
"We now have clear evidence that non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs are safe to use in patients with COVID-19," says the main author of the study, Ewen Harrison, of the University of Edinburgh.
He stressed that this finding "should reassure both doctors and patients."
However, further studies are still needed, as researchers did not take into account the duration of treatment.
Nor is it known whether the results can be applied to anti-inflammatory drugs used outside the UK.
The results of the study have been published in the scientific journal The Lancet Rheumatology.
