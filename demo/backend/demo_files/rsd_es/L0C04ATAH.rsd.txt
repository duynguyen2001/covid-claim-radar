Why is it not true that COVID-19 is losing its aggressiveness?
"The virus does have mutations, but they still do not confirm that it has become less aggressive or has a lower transmission capacity," says Caracol News health editor.
An Italian virologist was the first to say that COVID-19 was losing virulence, but this hypothesis does not have enough scientific support.
It is false that the virus is losing virulence because there are no scientific studies showing that this is happening.
In fact, there are studies in recent weeks that show that the evolution and particularly mutations in certain proteins of the virus - which are indispensable for entering the cell that they are infecting - are changing and these changes could lead to some degree to enhance the transmissibility of the virus, "explains Juan David Ramírez, laboratory director of microbiology at the University of Rosario.
Francisco Javier Díaz, a virologist and professor at the University of Antioquia, considers that "it is still early to know what the real effect of these mutations is."
So far, it can only be said that the virus exists and has the ability to infect.
There are still many doubts that scientists are trying to solve.
