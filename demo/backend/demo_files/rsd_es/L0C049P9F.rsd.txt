FEAE argues that drinking wine does not protect against coronavirus
The Spanish Federation of Enologists states that there is no direct relationship between the consumption of wine and the prevention of coronavirus infection
Santiago Jordi Mart√≠n, President of FEAE
On March 20, the FEAE, the Spanish Federation of Enologists, issued a statement entitled "Coronavirus and wine" in which they stated, regarding "the limitation of the effects of wine on the action of the virus," that "moderate consumption of wine, linked to responsible consumption, can contribute to better hygiene of the oral cavity and the pharynx, the latter area where viruses nest during infections."
These statements triggered a wave of criticism on social media towards the federation, as well as several media articles refuting the FEAE's claims.
For this reason, Spanish oenologists have wanted to clarify this Friday, April 3, that "in no case has the initial statement asserted or asserted that there is a direct relationship between moderate wine consumption and prevention of coronavirus infection," and that this is information made public "as a recommendation."
They also note that "the decision to disseminate this information comes from the International Union of Biologists, who decided to work with health institutions and their member organizations, including the FEAE."
Finally, the Federation of Enologists attributes the controversy to "misinterpretations" that "have been made by some media," stressing that this institution "represents the technical professionals qualified in the elaboration of wine," and that it "has a strong commitment to the veracity of the information."
