Is it safe to take ibuprofen to treat COVID-19 symptoms?
According to the School of Medicine of the
Harvard University
(United States), some French doctors discourage the use of ibuprofen (either patent or generic) for COVID-19 symptoms, as several reports from people with confirmed infection who were taking a NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) to relieve symptoms developed the disease in its severe form, particularly pneumonia.
These are only observations and are not based on scientific studies.

The WHO initially recommended using paracetamol instead of ibuprofen to help reduce fever and pain and discomfort related to this coronavirus infection, but now claims that both paracetamol and ibuprofen can be used.
Rapid changes in recommendations create uncertainty.
Since some doctors remain concerned about NSAIDs, it still seems prudent to choose paracetamol first, with a total dose not exceeding 3,000 milligrams per day.
However, if you suspect or know that you have COVID-19 and cannot take paracetamol, or have taken the maximum dose and still need symptom relief, you do not need to specifically avoid taking ibuprofen over the counter.
