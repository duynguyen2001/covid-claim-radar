Why does soap kill the COVID-19 virus?
Hand washing with soap has the benefit of physically removing viruses and bacteria from the skin.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the health authorities of each country have been responsible for informing their inhabitants that good hygiene prevents people from contracting the virus.
This is why worldwide campaigns have been launched on the importance of washing hands properly since soap is able to eliminate the virus.
This is because COVID-19 has an oily lipid membrane that covers the virus, which revives like a tire when the pin-like molecules that have soap penetrate into the types of bacteria and viruses.
Because of this, hand washing with soap has the benefit of physically removing viruses and bacteria from the skin, as reported by UNESCO.
