False: There are various cures for coronavirus that are hiding
In images uploaded by Facebook and WhatsApp, false information circulated claiming that there are "several useful cures against COVID-19," but that organisms "hide" because they cannot profit from them.
Today there is no approved treatment to cure COVID-19.
The COVID-19 pandemic is probably one of the greatest challenges facing modern medicine.
There are over 200 therapeutic candidates and over 1,700 clinical trials developing in record time.
Not only using new or existing drugs for other diseases, but also various supplements intended to help the patient control the infection.
While some treatments accumulate evidence of efficacy and obtain emergency authorizations in some countries, such as Remdesivir and Dexamethasone for severe patients, others are in very early stages of development or have already been discarded, such as Hydrochloroquine and Lopinavir / ritonavir.

In addition, for compassionate purposes, convalescent plasma is used in many countries as a treatment strategy for COVID-19.
There are several controlled clinical trials underway, which will allow the collection of more quality scientific evidence to confirm the efficacy and safety of this intervention.
As well as the hyperimmune equine serum, an Argentine treatment, which is already in clinical trial (More information on: https: / / confiar.telam.com.ar / se-est√°-realizando-donacion-de-plasma-de-patientes-recuperados-de-covid-19 / # 1588354789513-d2fc1bf0-5f13; https: / / confiar.telam.com.ar / el-suero-hyperimmune-de-equines-could-be-una-alternativa-therapeutic-para-patientes-gravos-con-covid-19 / # 1588354789513-d2fc1bf0-f13).
It is important to consider that there is no reason to hide a cure for a disease that causes death and deterioration in the economies of every country in the world.
Motivated by economic interests, many have encouraged the use of certain drugs, solutions, or procedures that ensure "cure COVID-19"; and this is not only pseudoscience or fraud (they have no human-proven scientific evidence against COVID-19) but can be harmful to health, so health authorities around the world have already warned about their use.
