Heat does not kill coronavirus and can facilitate its spread, says Russian scientist
Summer heat is not able to eliminate the coronavirus that lives on different surfaces and may even contribute to a higher infection rate in Russia, says Albert Rizvanov, director of the Clinical Research Center for Regenerative Medicine at Kazan Federal University.
Rizvanov leads the team that develops a coronavirus vaccine.
Low temperatures [of the air] increase the virus's survival capacity: the ideal temperature for the virus is 4 to 8 degrees [Celsius].
When air temperature increases, the virus becomes less stable.
(...) However, the virus is more often transmitted by air (by speaking, sneezing, coughing or simply breathing), by shaking hands and by contact with newly contaminated surfaces.
Very fast for the virus to decompose even in summer temperatures, "he says.
The scientist adds that when it 's hot, people tend to go out and contact more often.
"This can become an additional risk factor," he suggests.
At the time of writing this article, 252,245 cases of coronavirus had been confirmed in Russia, and 2,305 deaths from Covid 19 throughout the country.
