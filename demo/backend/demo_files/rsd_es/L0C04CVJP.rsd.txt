15 Oct (Reuters) - The drug remdesivir from Gilead Sciences Inc.
It has had no substantial effect on the survival chances of COVID-19 patients, according to a clinical trial by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Financial Times reported Thursday.
The antiviral, one of the first to be used as a treatment for COVID-19, was one of the drugs recently used to treat the coronavirus infection of US President Donald Trump.
The Financial Times report cites the results of the WHO Solidarity test, which assessed the effects of four possible drug regimens, including remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, the combination of lopinavir / ritonavir and interferon, in 11,266 hospitalized patients.
Hydrochloroquine and lopinavir / ritonavir were discontinued in June after they proved ineffective, but other trials continued in more than 500 hospitals and 30 countries, said WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan at an event Wednesday.
The study found that none of the treatments "substantially affected mortality" or reduced the need to ventilate patients, according to the Financial Times, which said it had seen a copy.
The WHO did not comment on the FT report, saying that the results of the study were not yet public.
Earlier this month, Gilead said remdesivir reduced COVID-19's recovery time by five days compared to patients receiving placebo in a study of 1,062 patients.
The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Gilead did not immediately respond to a Reuters comment request.
