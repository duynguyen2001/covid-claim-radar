Is it necessary to wear two masks together?
A very interesting contribution, I have always had doubts about the effectiveness of using a surgical mask on an FPP2... Today I am surprised that so many people use home-made fabric masks with different prints to go to fashion or "combined" with the rest of the clothes.
Thank you for sharing this information!
Greetings!
And why blue out?
For mere imposition or for some specific reason.
I especially studied having to teach with the white part inside towards unmasking if the mask, however, the reverse did not happen.
All in all, I would add that, for health care providers, when you don 't have ffp2 of the good, of the whole life, don' t listen to them, and in order to preserve ffp2, but also the adjustment improves considerably.
In this study we were able to confirm it quantitatively with a fit test, fit test.
An article from this study will soon be published in the specialist magazine http: / / www.amat.es / noticias / asepeyo _ combines _ la _ mascara _ autoflirante _ ffp2 _ with _ una _ mascara _ chirurgica _ que _ multiplita _ por _ 100 _ el _ factor _ de _ proteccion _ frente _ al _ covid _ 19.3php
Can it be effective, carrying a surgical mask, under a fabric, which may not be homologated or washed many times?, thank you very much!
