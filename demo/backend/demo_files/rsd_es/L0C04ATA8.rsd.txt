(CNN) - The number of coronavirus deaths in the United States has reached over 117,000, and is still growing.
Some states, including Florida, are seeing another disturbing trend: a record average number of new COVID-19 cases.
But, according to President Donald Trump, the coronavirus is "disappearing."
During an interview with Gray Television on Wednesday, Trump said he is not worried about his next meeting in Oklahoma because the number of new cases is "very tiny."
That despite data showing an increase in COVID-19 infections in dozens of states, including Oklahoma.
Trump said he is not worried about people getting sick or transmitting the virus to others because the demonstration will require temperature controls.
But masquerades are still optional.
Approximately 20,000 people are expected to attend, and social estrangement is unrealistic.
But Trump promoted the security of his campaign and praised Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt for his efforts to keep coronavirus numbers low, though on Tuesday, the state reported a record increase in new cases.
