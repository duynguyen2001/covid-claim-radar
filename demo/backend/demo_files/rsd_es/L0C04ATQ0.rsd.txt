A preliminary study by researchers at the prestigious Boston and Harvard Universities suggests that the epidemic may have arisen in the summer of 2019 in Wuhan, a central Chinese metropolis that was quarantined in January.
This study is based on satellite imagery showing an unusual influx of hospital parking in Wuhan since August.
It also shows the increase in queries of the word "tos" in the Chinese search engine Baidu.
This study, which has not yet been published in any scientific journal, could prove that China would have hidden the existence of the new coronavirus from the world for several months.
But the Chinese foreign ministry considered Thursday that the study is "flawed" and "burly fabricated."
The ministry's spokesman, Hua Chunying, sees in it evidence of a campaign in the United States to "deliberately create and disseminate disinformation against China."
"American political and media leaders act as if they had discovered a treasure, as if they had proof that China had hidden the epidemic," he lamented.
According to Chinese authorities, the new coronavirus was detected in December and China shared its genetic code with the World Health Organization (WHO) in early January.
The US and China have engaged in a battle over the origin of the virus in recent months.
US authorities suggest that he was able to escape from a laboratory in Wuhan, while Beijing implied that he might have been brought in by American soldiers.
