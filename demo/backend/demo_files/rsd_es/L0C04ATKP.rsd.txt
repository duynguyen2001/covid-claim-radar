You don't need to wear caps because viruses don't get airborne, says WHO
"Respiratory infections can be transmitted through ejaculated droplets when you cough or sneeze or when you are in contact with infected surfaces," the World Health Organization (WHO) wrote in a report published this Sunday, which discusses the ways coronavirus spreads.
However, unlike what was believed so far, "no cases of air transmission have been identified," so the use of public road covers as a means of protection is not necessary according to studies.
"The virus does not float in the air, nor is it possible to pass through it if we go out into the street and pass through a place where an infected person walked," the WHO explained and added that, therefore, "the infection can occur by direct contact with an infected person or by contact with a surface or object that he or she has used."
Still, the organization recalls that risk exists if the recommended safety distance - one meter - is not maintained, as it is exposed to "the infectious respiratory droplets that a person produces when coughing or sneezing."
On the contrary, nappies are necessary for doctors and nurses, as health professionals are in contact with people who have the symptoms and are normally unable to respect the recommended distance.
For this reason, the WHO urges the population to "not deplete the stock of these products," which are fundamental to these workers.
Finally, as the risk is mainly on surfaces such as plastic or wood, WHO places special emphasis on "the extreme importance of frequent hand hygiene and environmental disinfection."
