Security companies point out that cash does not infect COVID-19
One man holds several euro coins.
The Professional Association of Private Security Services Companies (APROSER) noted in a statement this Tuesday that there is no evidence that cash is a conduit for coronavirus infection, as the World Health Organization (WHO) has noted.
Faced with a stage of lower restrictions on commercial activity, many locals and businesses have shown uncertainty and ignorance about the security measures they must take, says APROSER, which recalls that cash should be considered as a payment system as valid as any other to progressively return to normal.
In order to ensure maximum safety, commercial establishments and premises must take measures such as clearly indicating the security distance of two metres between customers, as well as the distance with the seller, which must be at least one metre if protective elements such as bulkheads or protective face screens exist.
Otherwise, the distance should be extended to two metres.
In addition, establishments and premises must make available to the public disinfectant gels dispensers which must always be in conditions of use.
