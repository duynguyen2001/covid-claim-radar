CONFIRMED: Hydrochloroquine does not reduce the mortality rate of COVID-19
WHO confirms that hydroxychloroquine does not reduce the mortality rate of COVID-19, so the pharmacy will be suspended from the Solidarity testing program which is being applied in many countries with the aim of finding a treatment to combat coronavirus.
Dr. Ana Maria Henao Restrepo of the WHO Health Emergency Unit explained, "Internal evidence from the Solidarity / Discovery program, external evidence from the Recovery program, and evidence from those extensive random trial programs, suggest that hydroxychloroquine does not imply a reduction in the mortality of these patients."
Solidarity is a trial in which four treatment options will be compared with the standard of care to assess the relative efficacy of each of them against COVID-19.
Thanks to participation in the trial of patients from different countries, "Solidarity" aims to quickly discover whether any of the drugs studied delay the progression of the disease or improve the survival rate.
Additional drugs may be included in the trial depending on the data that will appear on them, according to WHO information.
According to the WHO, the program has so far provided more than $43 million thanks to more than 173,000 people and organizations.
