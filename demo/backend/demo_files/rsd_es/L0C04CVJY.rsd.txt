Combination of two drugs halves COVID mortality
A clinical trial in the United Kingdom has shown that tocilizumab, an anti-inflammatory drug, is able to reduce the risk of death in the most severe cases of COVID-19.
This makes it the second drug to have been shown to reduce mortality from coronavirus patients, along with dexamethasone.
The results of this study - called Recovery, which is testing in the UK several existing drugs for other diseases - conclude that "out of every 25 serious patients treated with tocilizumab, an additional life would be saved."
This is, by itself, able to prevent 4% of deaths.
An efficacy that may appear discreet, but that is triggered when tocilizumab is combined with dexamethasone.
Data suggest that in COVID-19 patients with hypoxia - those requiring oxygen - and significant inflammation, treatment with dexamethasone and tocilizumab reduces mortality by approximately one-third in patients requiring simple oxygen, and nearly half in those requiring invasive treatment - mechanical ventilation.
Dexamethasone alone has been shown to reduce deaths in these more serious cases by 33%.
A medicine for rheumatoid arthritis
Tocilizumab is a medication commonly used for rheumatoid arthritis, and is administered intravenously.
The results of the clinical trial certify that, in addition to reducing the risk of death among patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19, it also reduces recovery time and reduces the need for mechanical ventilation.
"We now know that the benefits of tocilizumab extend to all COVID patients with low oxygen levels and significant inflammation," said Peter Horby, an expert on emerging infectious diseases at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Recovery trial.
