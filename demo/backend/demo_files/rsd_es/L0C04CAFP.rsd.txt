The government did not prohibit people from moving "from one region to another" from December 21 to January 6, as a discontinued image shared via WhatsApp suggests.
The graph shows a post made on the Facebook pages of
Telenews
This Thursday reads: "From 21 December to 6 January 2021, it is forbidden to move from one region to another, except for health or work reasons."
However, these publications do not refer to a news story about Costa Rica, but about Italy, where the authorities made the decision to restrict mobility towards the end of the year celebrations, due to the covid-19 pandemic.
With regard to mobility, the country maintains the sanitary vehicle restriction from Monday to Friday from 10 pm to 5 pm and on weekends from 9 pm to 5 pm.
Teletica modified the posts, after publication, to point out that the mentioned measures were taken in the European country.
