A German expert believes it was the raccoon dog that transmitted the coronavirus.
The director of the Virology Institute at Charit√© Hospital in Berlin, Christian Drosten, who was one of the investigators of SARS in 2003, has pointed out in an interview that he believes the possible origin of coronavirus is the raccoon dog.
In an interview with The Guardian he said he sees no evidence that the virus passes through pangolins to humans, as some studies claim.
So he explained that "there is an interesting piece in the old Sars.
That virus was found in raccoon dogs, something that everyone has overlooked. "
He added that "raccoon dogs are a massive industry in China, where they are bred on farms."
So it was forceful to say that if I could go to China to investigate the origin of coronavirus I would look for "places where raccoon dogs are bred."
