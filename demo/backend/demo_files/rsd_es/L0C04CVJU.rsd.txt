ALTERNATIVE HORA CORONAVIRUS: Remdesivir IS reducing mortality in severe patients with COVID-19
Use of remdesivir in severe patients with COVID-19 is approved.
The Hospital Cl√≠nic de Barcelona, Catalonia, has conducted the first last-minute study to confirm that the antiviral remdesivir is effective in reducing mortality in patients with COVID-19.
The results were published in the Spanish Journal of Chemotherapy, in which they confirmed that data obtained in clinical trials, such as ACTT-1, associate remdesivir with a low mortality rate in these infected patients.
The improvement in days of hospitalization or progression of COVID-19 led to the approval of this drug as an antiviral for the treatment of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
