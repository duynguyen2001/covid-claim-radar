The first official case of covid in Italy was detected in Lombardy on 21 February 2020.
An article published in Tumori Journal by the Cancer Institute of Milan, Italy found that Covid-19 was already circulating in the summer of 2019 on Italian territory, long before the virus was reported in Wuhan, China.
Circulation in Italy would begin around September 2019, indicating that it spread outside China long before it was thought.
The first patient was officially detected in Lombardy, in a small town in the northern region of the country on February 21, 2020, however, a study published in Tumori Journal found that a group of healthy people enrolled in a lung cancer detection study had already developed antibodies against coronavirus since February 2019.
Patients enrolled between September 2019 and March 2020.
Another test conducted by the University of Siena on specific antibodies against coronavirus found that at least four cases date back to the first week of October when patients already showed antibodies that neutralise the virus, which would explain that they would be infected in September.
Giovanni Apollone, co-author of the study, said that "This is the main finding: people without symptoms not only gave positive after the serological tests, but also had antibodies capable of killing the virus."
Tests of participants in the lung cancer screening study indicated that of 959 subjects between September 2019 and March 2020, 11.6% of them (111) had coronavirus antibodies, 14% as of September 2019.
Italy currently records 1.21 million cumulative cases of coronavirus since the beginning of the pandemic, of which 442,000 have recovered and 45,773 people have died from coronavirus infection.
Italy has tightened the restrictions to prevent an even greater resurgence of the virus since in the last 24 hours alone 550 people have died and at least 40,000,902 new cases of infected people have been reported.
Lombardy, the region where the first case of coronavirus was officially detected in Italy, is the region with the most cases concentrated with 10,634 infections in the last 24 hours and approaching 20,000 deaths.
It is followed by Piedmont with 5,258 new cases, Campania (south) with 4,079 and Veneto with 3,605.
Tuscany and Campania are added to the list of regions that will also have to tighten their restrictions by order of the Italian government, restrictions that will come into effect from this year.
These two regions are joined by the Valle d'Aosta, Lombardy, Piedmont, Calabria and the autonomous province of Bolzano, which are 'red zones'.
Several European countries have experienced a significant escalation of new cases of coronavirus, forcing governments to impose stricter measures to avoid a second wave of more severe contagion.
Giuseppe Conte, Italy's prime minister, said that while national containment continues to be ruled out, partial measures for each region will be expected to work.
Last Friday he said that the Christmas festivities must be different and that it is not the time for big meetings to be held.
