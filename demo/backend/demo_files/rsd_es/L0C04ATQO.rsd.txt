It's a year since the first COVID-19 patient showed symptoms in China.
Today is a year since the first person to be confirmed with coronavirus infection in Wuhan, China, began showing symptoms of the disease that 365 days later already killed a million and a half people in virtually every corner of the planet.
According to Chinese authorities, patient zero of the deadly virus developed pneumonia on December 8, 2019.
After a year, science has failed to determine where the virus came from or how it was transmitted to humans.
That 's right, at that point, science is on the verge of having the vaccine in a historic event.
Last February, experts from the Chinese government explained that the pathogen probably originated in bats and jumped humans through pangolins.
However, they later hinted that the coronavirus was detected in imported food and that the possibility that it originated outside China could not be ruled out.
In July, the World Health Organization sent a team of researchers to Beijing as part of efforts to identify the origin of the pathogen, but has not yet been able to conduct a detailed study in Wuhan.
The pandemic is not yet under control, but the beginning of the solution can begin this December 8 when the UK begins its coronavirus vaccination campaign.
Dr. Peter Ben Embarek, a World Health Organization expert, has told NHK that it is logical to think that coronavirus originated in China, as it looks like a virus that was detected in 2013 in a bat cave in Yunnan province.
However, he stressed the need to investigate Wuhan and the surrounding area and to examine more closely the first cases recorded in that city.
