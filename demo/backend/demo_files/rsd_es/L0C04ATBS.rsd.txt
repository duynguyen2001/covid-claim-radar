They're innocent!
They reveal no coronavirus spread.
His initial hypothesis, that a coronavirus found in a pangolin had a genome 99% the same as that caused by Covid-19 in humans, proved to be erroneous, as a new analysis revealed that genome equivalence is around 90%, which is insufficient to claim that this animal was the origin of the pandemic.
According to scientists at the South Asian Agricultural University, pangolins were the intermediate animals between bats and humans, however, the institution warned from the outset that the results were not definitive.
The error, Xiao Linhua, co-author of the study, explained to Nature, was due to a communication error between the bioinformatics group and the laboratory group, as the 99% equivalence of the genome referred to only a small part of the coronavirus genome, i.e. only that of a protein that the virus uses to enter the cells it affects.
However, if the complete genome sequence is taken into account, the equivalence is reduced to 90.3%.
