Anonymous revealed the cure for the Coronavirus that hides the UN with frog tail?
Fake news about what Anonymous is revealing has been circulating social media since the global hacker network made its return on May 31, and this time it has been about the alleged Coronavirus vaccine.
Many people have been sharing an image of how Anonymous uploaded a video to their official Twitter account where it reveals that the World Organization has been hiding the vaccine that would save us from the pandemic that has been keeping in fear and within their homes a large part of the world's population, the Coronavirus.

However, they do not bother to read the last part where obviously everything is a joke.
The full message says:
You just uploaded to your Twitter account files about #UN where they are shown hiding the cure of COVID-19.
It shows that they already have a super-effective vaccine, the vaccine was made at 2 days and is made from frog tail cells and if not healthy today... it will be healthy tomorrow. "
So this is a fake news and a lesson more about reading everything you see on the Internet, especially if it has to do with Anonymous or the cure for Coronavirus.
