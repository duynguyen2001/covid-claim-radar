In Gibraltar they've already removed the street masks and the curfew

Yeah, that's exactly why they go without the mask, and the bars open until 2: 00.
One more CEBO for the EXPAUL BORREGOS to whom they have been told that EVEN VACUEN will continue with BOZAL and SUCIAL DISTANCE more RESTRICTIONS.
I've answered your question.

Masquerade, restrictions, ruin, bankruptcy, etc.
Gibraltar is therefore the centre of operations of the Covidian machine.
Everything fits JODER!
It's that the English are cold and distant people, they don't get infected like the Spaniards... and they've been carrying mascarias since the first dira...
Gibraltar and its miracles do not enter pateras nor the covid.
