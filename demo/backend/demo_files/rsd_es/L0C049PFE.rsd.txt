Investigate an aerosol that prevents Covid
Researchers at the Institute of Advanced Chemistry of Catalonia of the Conseil Superior de Investigaciones Cient√≠ficas (IQAC-CSIC) work on an aerosol that strengthens nasal and oral mucosa to waterproof them, with the aim of decreasing or preventing the penetration of COVID.
According to the IQAC and the CSIC, the study aims to develop aerosols with lipids similar to those of the skin, which emulate their impermeability by applying it to mucous membranes and thereby decrease viral infections.
Coronavirus infiltrates mainly through the nasal and oral mucosa, but has a low penetration through the skin.
"The impermeable properties of skin lipids can reinforce mucosa, increase barrier effect and reduce or prevent virus penetration," explained Maria Luisa Coderch Negra, researcher at IQAC and CSIC who directs the study.
The aerosol will not provide complete protection but will complement the use of masks and will partially avoid possible infection.
After optimizing the most appropriate methodologies for assessing mucous permeability, researchers will apply different aerosols based on skin-like compounds to nasal and oral mucous membranes to test their impermeability to water.
The penetration capacity of a coronavirus-like model through the mucosa protected with the new aerosol will then be analyzed.
There is now a large market to prevent the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses as well.
In addition, related formulations can be applied to prevent the penetration of toxins or contaminants, "said Dr. Coderch.
