Could marijuana help prevent coronavirus?
They guarantee it.
Other scientists show interest in the components of marijuana and coronavirus, a group of Israeli researchers have begun trials
In the search for cure and prevention for coronavirus there are more than 100 studies worldwide to obtain results as soon as possible.
A team of Canadian scientists is now studying cannabis as a prevention or treatment for coronavirus, and so far it seems that herpes and its component are promising in this task.
Researchers at the University of Lethbridge argue that a study conducted in April showed that at least 13 cannabis plants had high CBD content that appeared to affect ACE2 pathways, which the virus uses to access the body.
"At first we were totally stunned, and then we felt really happy," one of the researchers, Olga Kovalchuk, told CTV News.
Results in the online journal Preprints htps: / / www.prepoints.org / manuscript / 202004.0315 / v1 indicated that hemp extracts with high CBD content can help block proteins that provide a "gateway" for COVID-19 to enter host cells.
In other words, it could be a plausible strategy for decreasing susceptibility to the disease, as well as becoming a useful and safe addition to COVID-19 treatment as complementary therapy or preventive treatment.
Researchers are seeking funding to continue their efforts to support scientific initiatives to address COVID-19.
Other scientists prove interested in the components of marijuana and coronavirus, a group of Israeli researchers have begun clinical trials aimed at assessing whether CBD can be used as a way to repair cells damaged by Covid-19.
But look, there's not enough research to confirm the benefit of cannabis.
Smoking or vaping during an activated infection is not recommended, as it can further irritate the lungs.
In view of the current serious epidemiological situation, experts recommend not to use shaving as a cure or prevention.
