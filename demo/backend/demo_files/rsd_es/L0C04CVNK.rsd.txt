WHO updates: does not recommend the use of ibuprofen to treat Covid-19
The World Health Organization (WHO) has rejected the use of ibuprofen to treat disease caused by the new coronavirus, Covid-19, although it has recognized that its use does not cause any adverse effects.
The United Nations has said this after consulting doctors who treat patients infected with coronavirus, insisting that no adverse effects are reported in those who have received ibuprofen, but stating that it does not recommend it.
Precisely this week, the Spanish Agency for Medicinal Products and Health Products (AEMPS) also confirmed that there is no current data to confirm an aggravation of infection by covid-19 with ibuprofen or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
All of these statements came after the French health minister, Olivier VÃ©ran, warned that taking ibuprofen and other anti-inflammatory drugs could worsen coronavirus infection, so he recommended that those with fever take paracetamol.
"We are consulting with doctors who treat patients and we are not aware of reports of any negative effects, beyond the usual ones that limit their use in certain populations," the WHO said, to reiterate that, however, it does not recommend their use to these patients.
