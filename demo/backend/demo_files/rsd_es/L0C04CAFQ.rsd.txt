Florida does not implement White House recommended measures to prevent coronavirus infections
A report by the White House Coronavirus Working Group warns that many governors, including Florida, are not implementing measures to control coronavirus infections.
The document obtained by the Centre for Public Integrity was sent to the local authorities on 6 December and warns of the risks that exist if people gather in closed spaces outside their homes during Christmas festivities.
White House experts point out that states are not implementing the same measures that were ordered last summer, when coronavirus cases increased.
"Mitigation efforts must be stepped up... including the use of facial masks, physical distancing, washing hands, not holding indoor meetings outside immediate homes and aggressive testing," the White House task force report states.
It also explains that the increase in infections has been faster than the outbreak wave recorded in July.
Florida, according to this document, is in the red zone, indicating that it has had over 100 new cases of coronavirus for every 1000,000 residents in the last week compared to previous days.
Florida is also one of the states in the red zone of the test positivity rate, which means that more than 10% of tests in the state gave positive over the previous week.
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis maintains his decision not to impose the mandatory use of face masks, nor does he permit the imposition of fines, despite the request made by Southern Florida mayors to reinstate these measures.
