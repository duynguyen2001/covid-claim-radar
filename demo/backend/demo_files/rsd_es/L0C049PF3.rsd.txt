It is false that the newspaper paper does not transmit the COVID-19 virus......
In mid-April, various graphic media claimed that the newspaper paper did not transmit the coronavirus and that readers were not at any risk buying and manipulating it.
A study determined that the new coronavirus can remain active on print paper (such as diaries) or tissue paper (napkins) for up to 3 hours at 22ÂºC and 65% humidity.
On smooth surface papers such as banknotes, the virus remained active for up to 4 days.
The duration of the virus on these surfaces depends on temperature and humidity; at low temperatures it can remain active even longer.
With this evidence it cannot be ruled out that newspaper paper or other papers that are exposed or manipulated by infected people can transmit the virus.
Therefore, not being able to replace it with its digital version, it is recommended to manipulate it as products arriving from the supermarket, with the awareness that they may be contaminated.
It is recommended to use them for a short time, not to touch the face while handling them, to wash the hands immediately and to clean the surfaces that have been touched.
