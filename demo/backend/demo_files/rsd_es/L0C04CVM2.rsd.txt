Despite the controversy, ivermectin is safe: López Arellano
The Secretary of Health, Oliva López Arellano, acknowledged that there is debate and controversy about the use of ivermectin and other drugs in the treatment of Covid-19, but defended its application by noting that it has been shown in various clinical trials and protocols concluded in the population that it is safe and can have a positive effect.
In the perspective of a pandemic, where there are no specific antiviral drugs, it seems very appropriate to make the decision to generalize the use of ivermectin in the knowledge that it will not harm the population.
The official stepped in after the Coordinating Commission of National Institutes of Health and High-Speciality Hospitals recommended not to use this drug or azithromycin to treat coronavirus; she added that it is used in health centers and hospitals of the Mexican Institute of Social Security for severe cases.
López Arellano also asked the population to avoid the festivities for Candelaria Day and the "meeting of the tamalitos" in order not to have another peak of contagion in 15 days.
