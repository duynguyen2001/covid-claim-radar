Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients with COVID-19
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most widely used drugs and have a wide range of uses.
NSAIDs include non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors such as ibuprofen, aspirin (acetylsalicylate), diclofenac, and naproxen; as well as selective COX2 inhibitors such as celecoxib, rofecoxib, etoricoxib, lumiracoxib, and valecoxib.
Concern has been raised that NSAIDs may be associated with an increased risk of adverse effects when used in patients with acute viral respiratory infections, including COVID-19.
The objective of this review was to evaluate the effects of previous and current use of NSAID in patients with acute viral respiratory infections on acute serious adverse events, including mortality, acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA), acute organic insufficiency and opportunistic infections; on the use of acute health care, including hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), supplemental oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation; and on quality of life and long-term survival.
