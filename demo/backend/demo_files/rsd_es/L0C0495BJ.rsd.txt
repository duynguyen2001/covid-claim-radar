No, Raúl Rodolfo Abhuz Khan did not create the coronavirus
For Luisa Fernanda Gómez Cruz
The image of the YouTuber Auronplay was used in a screenshot that is being used in disinformation to "denounce" the "multimillion-dollar pharmaceutical business" behind the coronavirus.
On social media there is a supposed screenshot of a CNN news story, the American news chain, titled "Raúl Rodolfo Abouz Khan Biochemical engineer of Karmalah laboratories creator of coronavirus" (sic).
The note is accompanied by a photo of a man and a photo foot that says: "multimillion-dollar pharmaceutical business behind the coronavirus."
But all the screenshot information is false.
First of all, CNN did not publish this news at any time, as we can see by reviewing its official website.
The man in the photo is also Raúl Álvarez (Auronplay), a famous Spanish YouTuber who has been used several times in misinformation that we have verified on different occasions.
Finally, as clarified by the fact-checking media Maldita.es in its Maldita.es section, in an article we reproduced in Colombiacheck, the coronavirus appeared in media on 31 December 2019, when Chinese health authorities reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) cases of pneumonia of unknown origin in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, in southern central China.
The origin of the outbreak was identified in a live seafood, fish and animal market in Wuhan, which was closed by the authorities on January 1, 2020.
The first symptoms were reported on 8 December 2019: fever, dry cough, dysnea and radiological findings of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, according to the Spanish Ministry of Health.
With the available data there is evidence that person-to-person transmission has occurred.
So it 's also false that the virus was created in a lab by a biochemist, as the disinformation holds.
