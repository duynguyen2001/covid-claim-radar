WHO now does not recommend confinement as the main method to combat coronavirus
The WHO official for coronavirus in Europe, David Navarro, asked governments not to use confinement as the main method to control the spread of coronavirus, Antena 3 reported.
"We in the World Health Organization do not advocate bedbugs as the main means of controlling this virus," he said.
Navarro joined a group of experts in launching the Barrington Declaration, calling for an end to containment to deal with coronavirus.
The world recorded more than 378,000 new cases of coronavirus this Sunday on the last day, breaking the record for daily infections for the third consecutive day, and a particularly high death toll of more than 8,500 was also reported, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
