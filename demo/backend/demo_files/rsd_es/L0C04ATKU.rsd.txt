The Importance of Social Distraction
In view of the statements of the Minister of Government Mar√≠a Paula Romo that Ecuador will move from isolation to social alienation, it is necessary to understand what it means and why it is so important to respect it.
Since COVID-19 is transmitted from person to person, limiting direct contact would significantly reduce the spread of the virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines social estrangement as the minimum distance people must maintain between themselves.
The distance can vary but the recommended is a minimum of one and a half meters.
Since a person infected with COVID-19 remains without symptoms for a few days, it can spread without knowledge of the patient and their surroundings, which is why it is extremely necessary to respect physical distance when leaving home.
Group meetings, being in crowded or closed places should be avoided, nor is it recommended to be in places.
Physical distancing helps to limit the spread of the disease and since contact with contaminated surfaces can be maintained, proper hand washing must be performed, as well as following the basic hygiene standards enacted to combat the health crisis.
It is vital to follow and respect the recommendations made by official bodies.
The measures taken by the Ecuadorian government do not mean that everything will return to normal.
Today, more than ever, we must be responsible to avoid a fatal relapse.
