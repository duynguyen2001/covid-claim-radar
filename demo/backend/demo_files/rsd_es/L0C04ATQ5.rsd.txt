The coronavirus could have been circulating through China in August
MADRID, June 9
(EUROPA PRESS)
A study conducted by researchers at Harvard Medical School in Boston (United States) has revealed that the new coronavirus, whose disease is known as Covid-19, may have been circulating in Wuhan (China) since last August.
They have come to this conclusion after analyzing satellite images of parking lots in Chinese city hospitals as well as Internet searches on terms related to symptoms characteristic of the new coronavirus.
Indeed, according to expert analyses, the virus may have been circulating before it was detected in the Wuhan market, where it has so far been thought to have begun the spread of the disease and has affected most of the world's countries, including Spain.
Specifically, experts analyzed over 100 satellite images of Wuhan from January 9, 2018 to April 30, 2020, which
resulted in more than 200 photographs of parking lots and hospital areas in the Chinese city.
Thus, they were able to see that from August onwards there was an increase in views of the hospital centers, especially between September and October and culminating in the peak in December.
In addition, during that same period there was an increase in Internet queries about cough and diarrhea.
Finally, while the authors of the paper acknowledge that these increases in hospital visits and Internet searches cannot be directly related to coronavirus, they claim to support other papers in which coronavirus is said to have emerged before it was detected in the Wuhan market.
At the same time, they explain that in August there were many people looking for the symptom of diarrhea on the Internet, which is one of the most characteristic signs of Covid-19.
