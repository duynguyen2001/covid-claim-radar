What you should know about Patient Zero, the first coronavirus case in the world
Exactly a year ago, the first case of covid-19 occurred in the world, at that time it was still unknown that it was a disease that could become deadly and cause life as we knew it to end, today the world's population is already used to hearing figures that are often alarming about the high number of cases that exist, but all this started with a person who is identified as the 'patient zero', that is to say that he was the first person to carry the disease, at least of which is recorded, since many studies have now revealed that the virus may have been present long ago.
It was in Hubei Province in China that this first case was made, authorities tracked the chain of transmission until the first case on 17 November 2019, he was a 55-year-old man, not many details are known about him, but having him identified is key to understanding the current pandemic, identifying this first outbreak helped the world to take action before it became a pandemic and although many things have failed, the situation could be even worse than not knowing what we are facing.
Although the first case was reported in November, it was not until December 27 that Zhang Jixian, who was a doctor at the Provincial Hospital of Integrated Medicine of China and Western, who reported the existence of this new virus, made known its health effects and tried to alert his country's health authorities, that day the reported cases were 180 and by the beginning of 2020 had risen to 381.
Thanks to the identification of this so-called 'patient zero' the origin of the disease was discovered, now it is known that it may have come from the consumption of a wild animal, this information has undoubtedly helped research, not only to know the origin of the virus and its way of affecting the human body, it has also served to support the development of vaccines and medicines to treat it, currently it is said that we are close to getting a vaccine that will allow us to return to 'normality' in some years.
