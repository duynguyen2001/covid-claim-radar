Father Palmar: "The Covid was created to get Trump out of the White House"
Father José de Jesús Palmar Morales, known as the "Father Palmar" exiled in the US, shared through his Twitter profile a message from lawyer Juan Sosa, who in turn supports a theory that the contagious virus would have originated to promote voting by mail, in the general election held in the United States this November 3.

They deserve worldwide condemnation and life imprisonment for this great crime against humanity.
