Is it COVID-19 or COVID-19?
Let 's start with four basic things:
1 - All viruses mutate and much.
You don 't need a malignant mind to create a lethal virus.
They 're created alone and they' ve been doing it for millions of years.
The Spanish flu was much more lethal, for example, and even the DNA of bacteria contains traces that indicate that viruses have infected living things forever.
2 - The world is very interconnected.
Millions of people travel every day.
Countries like Spain or Italy receive about 80 million visitors each year, so it doesn't take a malicious mind to extend
I think the answers talk about the virus, not the disease.
COVID-19 stands for CoronaVirus Disease 2019 or Coronavirus Disease 2019.
So COVID-19 is the disease that produces the virus and not the virus itself.
The origin of the disease is the virus now classified as Sars-CoV-2 due to its similarity to the virus that produces SARS (2002).
The genome of this new strain of SARS CoV-2 matches 94.6% with this SARS COV-1 coronavirus that produced SARS disease in 2002 and 96.2% with the BAT Cov coronavirus.
The origin may well be merely a consequence of the (non-sexual) promiscuity conditions in which animals traditionally live in much of China.
Before exploring conspiracies, remember that the above is true and is extensively documented.
The name of the phenomenon that occurs when a pathogen jumps from one species to another is called Zoonosis, and several examples have been given throughout history, and not only in China.
Immediately, as another Quoran correctly answered a similar question; let us remember the Hanlon principle.
Which, basically,
