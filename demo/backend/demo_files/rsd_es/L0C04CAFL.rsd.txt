The government has not ordered the closure of Madrid, La Rioja and the Basque Country; it is a sham
The spread of coronavirus and the containment measures that governments around the world have taken successively are the hallmarks of cell proliferation.
This false information is often based on supposed inside information that is leaked beyond the control of institutions, and many others on mock montages in which official members are emulated in an attempt to deceive the population.
The latter is the case of a communication allegedly from the Ministry of the Interior announcing that "the Ministry of the Interior has changed the level of propagation alert to level 2A."
According to the false note, "on March 15, 2020, the Spanish army will carry out the total closure of the following autonomous communities: COMMUNITAD DE MADRID, COMMUNITAD AUTONOMA VASCA, COMMUNITAD AUTONOMA DE LA RIOJA (sic.
). "
It's false.
At the time of writing this news (Saturday morning, 14 March), the Government has not taken that decision and, beyond that, errors in the use of upper and lower case are evident throughout the text disseminated.
It is recommended to rely only on official sources (a screenshot of a supposed official document is not) and on media that offer contrasting and rigorous information.
Don't let them get to you.
