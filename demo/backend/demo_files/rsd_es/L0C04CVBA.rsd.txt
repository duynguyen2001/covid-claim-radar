Former Peruvian president and candidate for Congress, Martín Vizcarra, continues to defend the use of ivermectin against coronavirus, noting that its use helped to decrease symptoms in infected patients and prevented infection in healthy people who had taken it, reports RPP Noticias.
Vizcarra made his statements on a recent visit to Arequipa where he further questioned that the COVID-19 kits were not being delivered to the population.
He also criticized the suspension of COVID-19 (Tayta) Territorial Treatment and Isolation Assistance Operation, which he believed had reduced the incidence of coronavirus.
This is how ivermectin will be applied, the parasite that will be administered massively in Guayaquil.
It draws attention to the fact that a drug that has been delivered has been suspended since November.
How much of the population he has received can give faith and many can assure that he served in his treatment, "he said.
Vizcarra had offered similar statements last week when he pointed out that ivermectin "works despite not having a rigorous scientific, medical and laboratory finding," he said.
The statements of the former Peruvian president were questioned by various sectors and echoed presidential candidate Julio Guzmán who called the use of the drug "dangerous."
Martín Vizcarra never believed in science.
Not surprisingly, he now recommends treatment that has no scientific backing to 'cure' COVID-19.
"It's too dangerous," he said to the political management portal.
