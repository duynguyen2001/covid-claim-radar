Do your gloves protect you from Covid-19?
Here we go.
Incorrect use of gloves to protect oneself from the Covid-19 coronavirus on the street could create false protection and increase the risk of infection to the person carrying them, said the Mexican Society of Public Health.
Using his official Twitter account @ salutpublicaac, he indicated that gloves are not recommended when going out on the street, as only proper and frequent hand cleaning is the most effective way to avoid infection with the new coronavirus.
This, he detailed, because after a long period of time, gloves can become dirty and contagious, so if a person touches their face they may be susceptible to contracting the disease.
Removing gloves without contaminating hands is not easy, requires a specific technique.
Hand washing after use is recommended, "he said.
On the other hand, he pointed out that it is convenient to use gloves to wear and throw in the shops to choose fruit and vegetables as always has been done.
In the workplace, specific recommendations by health authorities must be followed.
