No shelter-in-place, no martial law in Kansas, police say



Police say there are no shelter-in-place orders and no martial law in place in Kansas.

Wichita Police Chief Gordon Ramsay said Friday afternoon on Facebook that the department has not been notified about any plans to enact such orders.

"While a few are over buying food and supplies, we have no food shortages and have strong supply sources to meet our needs," he said.

He reminded residents limit their exposure to others and help slow the spread of the virus.

The Kansas City, Kansas Police Department also asked that people stop spreading rumors about martial law.
The department said the Kansas National Guard is helping to distribute medical supplies.

The Kansas National Guard has 6,500 members.
Currently, only 21 are on active duty providing logistics support to the Kansas Division of Emergency Management.
