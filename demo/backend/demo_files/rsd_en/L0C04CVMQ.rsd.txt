Hydroxychloroquine not effective; time to 'move on:' White House coronavirus testing chief Giroir The White House coronavirus task force member charged with coordinating the U.S. testing effort said Sunday that the nation needs to "move on" from the debate over hydroxychloroquine, a drug President Donald Trump has promoted as a COVID-19 treatment even though there is no clear evidence it is effective.
Adm.
Brett Giroir, assistant secretary of health and human services, said on NBC News' "Meet the Press" that "from a public health standpoint, at first, hydroxychloroquine looked very promising" but at "this point in time, there's been five randomized control, placebo-controlled trials that do not show any benefit to hydroxychloroquine."


Nothing except thousands of doctors and nurses who see patients getting better by its use who the dear NHHS is not listening to...


Clearly the Lizard People have gotten to Giroir.

^^^No proof.
No evidence of people with COVID "getting better" with this dangerous drug's use.
Tall tale is this.

President Trump and many of his faithful posters are stubbornly clinging to unproven benefits of this anti-malarial drug.
Trump's own administration and health advisers say it shouldn't be used to treat the virus.

Look over here,Trumplings.

Maintain the culture war.
More bread and circuses and useful idiots.


Be distracted from my failure

.

No matter what the president says, the scientific medical evidence shows hydroxychloroquine is not an effective treatment for the virus.

No matter what the president says, the scientific evidence shows hydroxychloroquine is not an effective treatment for the virus.

According to a protocol-based treatment algorithm, among hospitalized patients, use of hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination with azithromycin was associated with a significant reduction in-hospital mortality compared to not receiving hydroxychloroquine.

It is just so obvious that the medical industry is as much -- if not more -- deep state as anything.
I am pretty sure a substantial number of them are conspiring to keep the numbers looking bad just because they hate Trump.

If you assume that 50% of doctors and nurses are libs... it is obvious.

It has been obvious for years that doctors will let any patient die if it means they get something personally.

^^^This flawed "study" has been widely criticized by scientists and medical professionals.
Seems only Trump, campaign paid witch doctors, the Trump campaign sycophants and Peter Navarro carry the torch for this dangerous drug which is ineffective in the treatment of COVID.

"I think at this point, we can definitively say hydroxychloroquine doesn't work.
I'm not sure what more we need to do," former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who served under Trump, told MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle a day ago.

"Based on ongoing analysis and emerging scientific data, we (FDA) have revoked the emergency use authorization (EUA) to use hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat COVID-19".
July 2020

Admiral.
Brett Giroir, the Trump administration’s coronavirus testing czar, said 2 days ago: "we need to move on from Hydroxychloroquine.
Most physicians and prescribers are evidence-based and they’re not influenced by whatever is on Twitter or anything else.
And the evidence just does not show Hydroxychloroquine is effective ".
On Meet The Press.

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, a vocal proponent of hydroxychloroquine, told CNN yesterday the administration is "sitting on millions of doses" of the drug.

Uh Huh, thanks Peter.
You are another stable genius, aren't you?

Outrageous Trumpian imitated campaign bull$%#*, IMO.

Look over here,Trumplings.
Foment and exacerbate my culture war.
Here you go, more bread and circuses.
Everyone is deep state and out to prevent my re-election.
Your nurses and doctors, your beloved 4th grade teacher, your mom.
Be distracted from my failure.
And never ever believe that my cronies and I have invested heavily in this dangerous drug that I need to sell you.


Good watch here
