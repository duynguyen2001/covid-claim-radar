China’s media promotion theory that COVID started in a US laboratory



A Chinese state broadcaster has highlighted a conspiracy theory that a deadly coronavirus pandemic has occurred in a U.S. military laboratory, saying that "something suspicious" is happening in Fort Detrick, Maryland.
He insisted and refused that COVID started at the Wuhan Institute.

A female anchor on Thursday at China’s central television station asked the viewer: "What exactly was the fish business happening?"
The Daily Mail reported.

Her question was asked after Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, asked the United States to open Fort Detrick for inspection by World Health Organization officials.

"If the United States really respects the facts, it will open a biological laboratory in Fort Detrick, give transparency to issues like more than 200 overseas biological laboratories, and carry out its origins to WHO experts.
I would like to emphasize that we should encourage you to do so-we will track in the United States and respond to concerns from the international community in action, "Hua said at a press conference on Monday.

The broadcaster said Fort Detrick’s lab was described by the US press as "the darkest experimental center of the US government" without actually appointing a specific organization.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19, which occurred in Wuhan in December 2019, is likely to have been transmitted to humans through bats, but the exact source has not been identified.

Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo released a fact sheet last week that the U.S. government "believed" that researchers in Wuhan’s lab got sick while working on a "secret project."
Seems to be a reply to.
Chinese troops arrived last fall before the disease spread worldwide.
