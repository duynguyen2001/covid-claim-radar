Revised Ohio COVID-19 health order: Masks, social distancing at bars and restaurants still required



Ohio's mask mandate remains in effect, officials clarified after confusion over a new order that replaced 18 others.

Last week, Gov.
Mike DeWine announced the state would simplify coronavirus-related restrictions on businesses, events and more.
At the same time the revised order was issued, another order rescinded 18 others including the state's face mask order.

People who only saw the latter might have thought that meant facial coverings and other mitigation measures, such as requiring space between tables at bars and restaurants, were no longer required.
But the new, broader order stated in the second section that masks were still required in indoor spaces outside of one's home and other situations.

Ohio Department of Health Director Stephanie McCloud signed a revised health order on Friday meant to clear things up.

The revised order includes new language that clarifies:

The mask mandate for K-12 schools hasn't changed and remains in effect.

Tables at restaurants, bars and banquet facilities must be spaced 6 feet apart unless there is a physical barrier between them.

Restrictions on congregating and social distancing requirements do not apply to religious observances and other First Amendment activity.
But the face mask requirements do apply.


Both the original and amended orders consolidated 18 different health orders.
Instead of limiting gatherings to 10 people, the orders suggest distancing and limiting the grouping of people within large gatherings to 10.

DeWine has said all health orders, including the mask mandate, would be lifted when Ohio reaches a rate of 50 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents during a two-week period.
That number was 183.7 on Thursday.
