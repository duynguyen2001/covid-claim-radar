Youtube


A Nevada nurses video has gone viral and even gotten noticed by The New York Times, according to The Source.

Nicole Sirotek posted a video about working in hospitals in New York City where she says medical staff has been committing acts of negligence against minority patients so much so that she says they are being "murdered."

Sirotek says that she has seen an anesthesiologist improperly intubating a patient, a resident using a defibrillator on a patient with a heart rate, and another patient being given the wrong insulin.

All of the patients Sirotek described had died and at one point in the video the nurse says "They don’t care what is happening to these people.
… It’s like going into the f**king Twilight Zone."

Sirotek was transferred after posting the video, she was working at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens.
