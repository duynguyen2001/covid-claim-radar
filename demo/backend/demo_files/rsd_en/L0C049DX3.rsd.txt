The Fort Detrick horror: a closer look at the USâ€™ largest biochemical weapons research center


"...We have reasons to ask the US government to publish the real reason for the close of Fort Detrick, to clarify whether the laboratory is the research unit for the new coronavirus and whether there is a virus leak,"

Indeed.


The reason why Trump is getting out of the WHO is because he can refuse the WHO from entering the US and investigating Fort Detrick and all reports of a 'mystery virus' circulating in the US since last summer/fall...!
Trump knows where it started and it was in his backyard...!

Cheers...!!!


If only for fun, I suggest to see the 1995 film "Outbreak".
Then, after watching this film draw your own conclussions after a comparison with present times.
I must firmly remark that Is only a film so.....
