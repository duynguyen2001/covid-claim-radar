Who do you think is better at defeating Coronavirus, Donald Trump or Dr.
Anthony Fauci?


Neither.
I take my own advice and realize that the virus will come and go as it cycles through its mutations and we progress in opening up the economy.
I also am prone to agree with scientists who note that the health of the "herd" requires that the virus be allowed to run its course in the population.

Most — if not all — of us will contract COVID-19 at some point in our lives regardless of precautions taken.
In fact, vaccinations are a means to expose everyone to a form of the COVID-19 virus albeit one that is intended to elicit an immune response without the negative consequences of full blow


Any person who believes the virus is fading is brain dead.
Several states have thousands of new cases.
Ppl in Florida added 5,500 cases today.
For One MF DAY That is not fading.
26 states r already out of ICU beds.
Trump knows nothing about anything.
He is as dumb as a rock which is why he was voted in, legally or illegally, by republican contributors who want to make the rules.
They want this country to be run by and for themselves.
Therefore the various branches of safety have to go.
Courts have to go.
Trump is doing nothing to help "his" ppl b/c he couldnt care any less about We the People
