COVID-19 vaccine ‘boosters’ to become the norm in future, says genome expert


Why doesn’t the CDC and Fauci trust the miracle vaccines they have pushed on us?
Why is the CDC Chief warning us of impending doom after the vaccine rollout?
Now we must get a booster each year?
Are they tacitly acknowledging that Coronavirus vaccines have an Achilles Heel?

The 2012 Coronavirus Vaccine Study showed that Coronavirus Vaccines protected against the original strain, but then created immunopathology in the test subjects causing them to be hypersensitive to future Coronaviruses.
All test subjects later succumbed to later Coronaviruses.

If hypersensitivity to future coronaviruses is a "known feature" of Coronavirus Vaccines, then it might explain why we are being told that the "worste is yet to come" and being prepared for a yearly Coronavirus booster.
Each year COVID-19 Vaccinated individuals will have to get a successive vaccine or they may die of Covid-22, Covid-23, or COVID-27 because of immunopathology.
Hence, the year identifier.
This has been known for at least 8 years.
It even appears that this "known" vaccine "feature" was intended to be released with Event 201 as the kickoff.

There is no downside for Big Pharma / Medical Establishment / Deep State.
Any new hypersensitivity resulting in Coronavirus deaths can be blamed on a new Coronavirus strain.
Which is half right!
The other half of the story is vaccine induced vulnerability.
You will not hear this reported by the medical establishment or the enemedia.

This dangerous vulnerability injected into each of our immune systems could then used for nefarious political purposes.
It doesn't take much imagination to picture a future in which elites have this power over us...



We have to appreciate that we were always going to have to have booster doses; immunity to coronavirus doesn’t last forever


How long does it last?
Either the vaccine immunities or immunities from actually contracting COVID?


They have us by the throat now, and they are never going to let go.


Repeat business ... even if they could cure the disease why would they?
That’s discounting the possibility to use a gene therapy technique to achieve other ends.


You hit it smack, dead center could not have described any better.
Yet people flock for these shots even so alternate methods are available without any side effects down the road.
Would not be at all surprising if this will be an ongoing affair.
For each mutation a new shot and if you don’t, watch out.
I hope with all my heart it doesn’t work out this way but it could very well.


re: "COVID-19 vaccine ‘boosters’ to become the norm in future, says genome expert"

It’s like, purchasing a perpetual "license" to a version of MS Office 360 ... the "Gates" model.


"Top Experts"

Yea right


"...If hypersensitivity to future coronaviruses is a "known feature" of Coronavirus Vaccines... ******************************************************************** Yes, and what if changing your DNA so your future children are dwarf morons was a "known feature"?
Or if sterilizing you was a "known feature"?
Probably just as plausible and useful for scaring people.





They don't have a clue.
That's why they are trying a bit of CYA with this booster shot storyline.


‘Repeat business ... even if they could cure the disease why would they?’

we could say that about any given medical issue...

i’ve already had Covid and there’s no goddamn way I’m getting the vaccine booster shot.
This illegitimate regime can kiss my azz.


And boy do we have a bumper crop of morons.


"The other half of the story is vaccine induced vulnerability.

And when you happen to own the media, and have launched mass censorship...


You must not have read the 2012 Coronavirus Vaccine study.
Reading is fundamental.


Now remember, it is nothing like the flu.
One vaccination and that will be it.
But wait, it mutates just like the flu, kills like the flu, and the vaccine yearly guess will be a swag as to what mutation is in favor.


No, we have Covid by the throat now actually and we’ll let up when it’s eradicated.


(When a bunch of commies start telling you that you don't need an AR15, you really need an AR15)


We be living in an insane asylum now.
Allowing man to modify the DNA our Creator wrote.
Those against Him love it.
Why would a person of YHVH God allow this masquerade into their life.
