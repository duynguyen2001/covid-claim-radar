Disinfo: The coronavirus is a biological weapon created by the UK


The coronavirus 2019-nCoV is a biological weapon developed by the British, even if they pursued scientific goals.

On June 23, 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice granted scientists at the Pirbright Institute (formerly Animal Health Institute, England) the patent No.
10.130.701 for the invention of a "live attenuated coronavirus".
So, molecular biologists saw structural details similar to the 2019-nCoV on the electron microscope image of the "British invention".

Conspiracy theory.
This is a pro-Kremlin narrative about the coronavirus and the "Anglo-Saxons".

In response to the outbreak of the corona virus the Chinese authorities have placed more than a dozen cities under quarantine.
The World Health Organisation is working with Chinese authorities and global experts to learn more about the virus.
The virus "2019-nCoV" comes from a family of viruses that include the common cold, and viruses such as SARS and MERS.
There is no evidence to suggest it was developed artificially as a weapon of mass destruction.
