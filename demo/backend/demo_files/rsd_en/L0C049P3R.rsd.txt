Why isn't Asia susceptible to Covid ?


Looking at Worldometer when switched to show Asia and, with a couple exceptions, the presence of Covid outbreaks is pretty tiny.

How is this?

I refuse to believe that all of those countries have better health systems or are implementing measures any better than the west.

Either they are all lying with their stats or there is something else going on.


They were quick to act.
Test n Trace and border control.

Regional Immunity?
Why Asia Has Avoided The Worst Of COVID-19


East Asia is home to 30% of the world's population but has recorded only 2.4% of the COVID-19 global death toll.
Scientists are looking at possible immunity from past epidemics or even genetics.

Across the continent, people were quick to adopt mask-wearing without question, as wearing this protective gear was already common practice in Japan and South Korea.
"The big differences with the West have been the strict border shutdowns and the rigorous testing of infected people, whether they were sick or asymptomatic," notes Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore.


Great school name there BTW

So yes they implemented measures much better then the West and much quicker.

Sometimes I pretend I am a carrot.

I don't believe every single country in Asia did that or has the capability to do that.

Good article though so thanks for that.

So it looks like asians are genetically immune.

and yes had a little trouble spelling the user name when registering.

It caused much amusement to some.



I said school name, from the article, not user name

So if you don't believe it, why do you think it is?

Also look at places like NZ too.

The countries that acted the quickest and did the right things prospered better in some ways

Border control and test n trace are the two biggies, look at how long it took us and how slow we were to react.

The closer a country is to both the equator and the international date line the lower the incidence it has of covid.
Of the USA states the ones with two out of the three lowest deaths per million fall into that category.
Correlation is not causation...

The article says why it thinks it is.

Genetic immunity.

Sounds the most rational because there is no way every single country managed to lock down early and test and trace.

Right, wasn't sure if that's what you believed or just quoting a bit from the article.

Thanks, I got used to it now.


A big thing is it's been a constant threat for the Far East and they've been through SARS and MERS so much easier to convince a populace to take basic measures and do it quickly.

There's also something to be said for building up a very strong immune system due to poor quality sanitation for generations.

We probably over use bleach at home at a guess, it certainly has its place though.

I heard something the other day on the World Service that was making exactly this point...they had both people/equipment/testing/tracing systems ready to go because of SARS and MERS...both of which are also types of Coronavirus (and the common cold IIRC).

Past history tells us that Corona variations are highly likely to emerge in that part of the world first so they are always on a higher level of alert/preparedness and so is the general population a percentage of whom went through those events.

Maybe too those past events also mean that politicians are more willing to be "strict" sooner and less worried about staying "popular".
And whilst it is a sweeping generalisation many parts of the Far East are fairly monocultural with more of a tradition of "compliance"...and some of them not slow to send out law enforcement who do not "engage with people" or "advise" them to "go home" but show them the sharp end of bamboo canes.

Compliance is a massive consideration in government's response around the world.

You can see in Germany, fairly will known to be rule followers, have done well whereas the likes of us and the US haven't faired well.

We've sadly not got enough jail cells to house those who flout the law so dramatically, such as the organisers of parties, weddings and so on where there have been hundreds in attendance during the lockdowns.

This may be true for individual countries, but not for every single one of them.
Some of them have barely got a sanitation system let alone a comprehensive test and trace system or the ability to enforce strict lockdowns.

There must be something else that is going on.

NZ is interesting because the Maori population is much more susceptible to Flu outbreaks that the European population.

If you talk to people, they will claim its deprivation that is the cause but if you look at the NZ government pandemic response document it does actually say there may be genetic makeup differences.

Maybe it goes the other way for flu.

From the incidence figures it also appears that the 200K western population in Thailand have acquired this genetic immunity.
As have the western origin population of Hong Kong, Macao, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos....

As the genetics of this population will not have changed to when they were born (in the west) it looks more likely that the measures taken in these countries to stop the spread of covid were effective.

The main difference in the genetics would be that many Asians lack the ability to produce the enzyme (lactase) to digest milk when adult vs those mostly of northern european ancestry who can.
So one group has a diet which will use coconut milk and the other group animal based dairy products.
So diet may also be a factor.

Yup it's a myriad of factors all kicking in.

I'm definitely not a fan of people trying to boil it down to, effectively, 'it was Boris that done it' without digging into some of the reasons that governments across the globe made the decisions they have.
Absolutely the government could have acted sooner, but would people have accepted that?

I like the quote from the WHO doctor in the Panorama documentary last night that went along the lines of 'Europeans nations seemed to need to have experienced the deaths themselves before accepting the seriousness of the pandemic'.

For some of the richer Asian countries like Japan and South Korea, where it's typical to see people in masks in the decades before Covid hit, the 'been there, done that' plays a massive factor in the populations willingness to do the right thing.

An ageing population, which is common in Europe, is clearly one of the biggest indicators of a high death toll.
We have an average age of 40 years ish and if you look at Africa or South America, and a lot of the poorer Asian countries like India their population is 10-15 years younger than ours.

Although a quick google produces median age Japan: 48.6 (70 deaths per million) Hong Kong: 45.6 (27) South Korea: 43.2 (33) Taiwan: 42.3 (0.4) Macau: 40.8 (0) UK 40.6 (1,852 deaths per million) (DPM 4,630 * Taiwan, 56 * South Korea, 26 * Japan)

Five countries with higher median age have much, much lower death per million rates.
What they have in common is that they locked down earlier and/or masked up earlier.

Well if a population is not getting infected then a minority won't have anybody to catch it from....thats how herd immunity works.

and then we have this......

So even in western countries Asians have much lower risk.

Yeah, I was fairly clear about the relatively rich nations bit and also having experienced SARS and MERS so wearing masks in public was already commonplace.

For poor nations the low median age helps reduce deaths.

Germany had a good first wave, but they had a bad second and now third wave.

They had just 10,000 deaths up to October, but they're now past 75,000 and have the fourth highest death toll in Europe.

That graph is the USA.
UK stats show BAME figures to be higher.

Considering deaths up to 28 July 2020, males and females of Black and South Asian ethnic background were shown to have increased risks of death involving the coronavirus (COVID-19) compared with those of White ethnic background

They are definitely being hit hard and now not benefitting from the most at risk having been vaccinated.

Not seen any news about how the Germans are dealing with the new lockdowns, they could be getting fed up and complacency kicks in.

Sadly for the rest of Europe I suspect the UK is going to move down the deaths per capita table in Europe.

Yes if you add the Black and other susceptible minorities to the asian figures, you will get a higher number for sure.



BorkenArrow said: Yes if you add the Black and other susceptible minorities to the asian figures, you will get a higher number for sure.


Try looking at the graphic for figure 1 which show by seperate ethnic group.
Again white per 100,000 rate is lower than any other group.


I can only presume you are pushing this genetics line for an agenda that it wasn't the early lockdown, test and trace, masking that lead to the lower deaths rates seen in many Asian countries but "

asians are genetically immune

".

As such it tries to takes any blame away from the UK government for being late to the party and failing to act as quickly as some other, more sucessful, countries did.
UK figures show that Asians are not genetically immune when the mortality rates are compared together in the same country.


It would be interesting, from a scientific perspective to see how many have been asymptomatic.
Some countries in SE asia, such as Cambodia came through relatively unscathed, but had an outbreak recently in the capital city which has now started to spread - and these are areas with little/ low level health care.
There is likely a multitude of factors though, including levels obesity being significantly lower, more time spent outside etc
