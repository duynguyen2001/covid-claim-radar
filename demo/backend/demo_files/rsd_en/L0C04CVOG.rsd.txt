Medication That Can Shorten COVID-19 Recovery Time Arrives in Pa.



Harrisburg, Pa.
(WENY)-- A medication that’s been shown to shorten recovery time for COVID-19 patients has made its way to Pennsylvania.

It’s called Remdesivir, and it’s an antiviral medication that was originally created to fight Ebola.
According to state Health Secretary Dr.
Rachel Levine, Pennsylvania has received 1,200 doses from the Federal Government.
It’s not a direct cure for the Novel Coronavirus, but it does help patients recover more quickly.

"It has been shown in a recent clinical trial to shorten the recovery time in some people, which is why the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, has authorized the emergency use of this medication for the treatment of severely ill patients with COVID-19," explains Dr. Levine.

The first 1,200 doses of Remdesivir have been doled out to 51 hospitals across Pennsylvania, based on need.

"The hospitals that received the first shipments were selected based on their numbers of COVID-19 patients over a recent seven day period, and the severity of the illness of those patients.
We continue to work to give our hospitals all the tools that we possibly can to treat patients with COVID-19," explains Dr. Levine.

According to the FDA, Remdesivir decreases the amount of coronavirus in a patient’s body, which helps them recover faster.
It’s given to a patient via intravenous fluids once a day.
Dr. Levine says patients can be put on one of two regimens.

"One is a five-day course which includes six doses, and there’s a ten-day course for even more severely ill patients which involves eleven doses.
It depends on how critically ill the patient is," Dr. Levine says.

The supply of Remdesivir is being managed on the Federal level by the Department of Health and Human Services.
Dr. Levine says Pennsylvania will receive more shipments of the medication on a weekly basis over the next several weeks.
