Getting Answers: Can stomach acid kill the coronavirus?


TUCSON - A News 4 Tucson viewer asked us about ingesting the coronavirus from food or drinks and if stomach acid kills the coronavirus.

There was a rumor circulating on social media that stomach acid kills coronavirus, however that is false.

News 4 Tucson's Priscilla Casper answered this question in her Getting Answers segment Wednesday night.

In regards to this question, the World Health Organization states:

"There is no evidence that drinking lots of water flushes out the new coronavirus or the stomach acid kills the virus."

When it comes to eating food, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states:

"Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food."

The CDC advises to wash your hands with soap and water for about 20 seconds before preparing or eating food.
