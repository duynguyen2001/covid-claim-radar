Will the coronavirus survive in the refrigerator or freezer?


A 2010 study used two viruses that are related to the COVID-19 virus to look at the effects of temperature and humidity on viral survival.
Researchers found that both lower temperatures and lower humidity helped viruses survive longer.
In particular, at 4 degrees C, or 40 degrees F, and 20% relative humidity, more than two thirds of the viruses survived for 28 days.
On the other end of the spectrum, at 40 degrees C, or 104 degrees F, and 80% humidity, the viruses survived for less than 6 hours.

This suggests that coronaviruses survive better on surfaces at colder temperatures.
It is also expected that the virus would survive being frozen.

It is important to wash your hands and your produce, following sound food handling guidelines.
Also, clean surfaces using approved disinfectants.
