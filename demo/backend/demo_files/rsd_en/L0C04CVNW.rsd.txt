- New information.
A study confirmed the drug Remdesivir shortens the length of illness for people who get COVID-19.
The study was just published in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The drug proved to be effective in patients from all demographics, even non-white patients who have had a higher risk of severe disease from COVID.
It is important to note this does not mean the antiviral Remdesivir is a cure.
But it does show the drug can go a long way toward making the virus less severe.
