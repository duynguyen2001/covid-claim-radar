[NEWS] India proved that Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine can not just fight COVID-19 but..


I’m not sure the person who was hoodwinked is the person you think.

(It was the top prescribed drug for treating covid for much of the pandemic) Just like there was no evidence that covid came from the wuhan lab.
The evidence is there, but you guys will keep your head up your ass and sometimes will finally come around much later.
Thank God for Trump.
You're a fool.

Quote:Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) revoked the emergency use authorization (EUA) that allowed for chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate donated to the Strategic National Stockpile to be used to treat certain hospitalized patients with COVID-19 when a clinical trial was unavailable, or participation in a clinical trial was not feasible.
The agency determined that the legal criteria for issuing an EUA are no longer met.
Based on its ongoing analysis of the EUA and emerging scientific data, the FDA determined that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19 for the authorized uses in the EUA.
Additionally, in light of ongoing serious cardiac adverse events and other potential serious side effects, the known and potential benefits of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine no longer outweigh the known and potential risks for the authorized use.
This is the statutory standard for issuance of an EUA.
The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services originally requested the EUA covering chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and the FDA granted the EUA on March 28, 2020 based on the science and data available at the time.
Today, in consultation with the FDA, BARDA sent a letter to the FDA requesting revocation of the EUA based on up to date science and data.

Quote:The fact that no bat or other animal has been found infected with anything resembling the COVID virus, which suddenly swept through Wuhan at the end of 2019, "has put the lab leak hypothesis back on the table," although there is no evidence supporting that theory either, he said.

https://www.modernhealthcare.com/technol...n-lab-leak Thank GOD for science and not idiots like you and trump!
lulz, tell me again what the side effects of hydroxychloroquine are again?
Remember, this is a standard dose for the treatment time for covid, not 5000% of the dose taken daily for a year.
Also, the tests that said hydroxy didnt work was where the patients were too far detiorated.
Its not going to help when organs have shut down.
It helps by preventing the virus from replicating in the body.
And wasnt it you who promoted the work of the porn star who said it didnt work?
Why, yes it was.
How embarrassing for you and the Lancet.
Reading issues again?

Quote:...ongoing serious cardiac adverse events...

Plus...

Quote:This includes reports of serious heart rhythm problems and other safety issues, including blood and lymph system disorders, kidney injuries, and liver problems and failure.

https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-an...setting-or And once again, you're lying about the Lancet study.
No, it was not the work of a porn star.
And unlike you, they're at least able to admit mistakes.
They didnt admit their mistake on their own, and btw, thats a mistake that should have never gotten through peer review of a journal like that.
It was others who reviewed the data submitted, determined it was garbage, then found out that the authors were a sci-fi writer and an "adult model".
You were hoodwinked again, by someone who made money flashing her t*ts.

Dude, you just don't have the first clue what you're talking about.
And FWIW, the New England Journal of Medicine also had to retract an article that relied on that firm.
https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lance...2/fulltext

Further, nothing to my knowledge has actually said the results of that group were wrong, only that they could not be relied upon by the stories authors because they were not able to review them.

If you think I'm going to feel the slightest bit of regret for posting articles from respected outfits like the New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet that they end up retracting rather than swallowing your made up **** with no sources and never an apology for a mistake, you're even more delusional than I thought.

Finally, in the retraction article I linked above, it details that your cult leader's miracle drug was worthless for Covid regardless of retracting their original story.
And the FDA, the CDC, and legitimate doctors all know and recognize.
But hey...we'll listen to a secretary who signs off on "audits"!

Quote:Hydroxychloroquine is a 4-aminoquinoline that prolongs ventricular repolarisation, as evidenced by prolongation of the QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) on the electrocardiogram.
QTc prolongation can be associated with a specific ventricular arrhythmia called torsade de pointes, which, although often self-terminating, can degenerate into ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, leading to death.
Torsade de pointes is a rare event, with an estimated annual crude rate of 3·2 per million population; the incidence is almost doubled in women compared with men and increases with age.
Drug-induced torsade de pointes mostly occurs by blockade of the cardiac rapid delayed rectifier channels in the presence of several risk factors, including high drug concentration, simultaneous exposure to multiple QTc-prolonging drugs, coronary heart disease, heart failure, hypokalaemia, bradycardia, or congenital long-QT syndrome, among others.
The risks of cardiac adverse events associated with hydroxychloroquine during the COVID-19 pandemic might increase for several reasons.
Patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have multiple risk factors for drug-induced proarrhythmia: hypokalaemia, in the 3·0−3·4 mmol/L range, is common; fever amplifies drug-induced blockade of cardiac rapid delayed rectifier channels; and an increase in interleukin-6 concentrations, as seen in SARS-CoV-2 infection, has been suggested as a mechanism of the QT prolongation associated with inflammation.7 Also, high doses of hydroxychloroquine are often administered in COVID-19, many patients receive co-prescriptions with QT-prolonging drugs, including azithromycin,7, 8 and about 30% of patients with COVID-19 have myocardial injury.9 These are risk factors for torsade de pointes or ventricular tachycardia.5 QTc prolongation associated with hydroxychloroquine is amplified in patients with COVID-19 compared with non-COVID-19 patients, with 10–20% of patients with COVID-19 having QTc values of more than 500 ms.



How about bleach up the ass?
Does that work too?

Again, this is "HIGH DOSES" in conjunction with OTHER DRUGS.
Hydroxy itself is one of the safest, if not the safest drug on the planet.
The article from porn star wannabe science data writer was FAKE.
But yet here you are holding on dearly to what it said, because you think it proves Trump wrong.
People who do that are mentally ill.

Not.
For.
Covid.

What part of that can you not understand?

And no asshat, I'm not relying on that study at all.
I'm relying on science, the FDA and the CDC.

You are relying on a guy who can't even put on a spray tan properly.

Yes, for malaria and autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.

That’s not a metric, and that includes the majority of all prescribed medications.
If that’s what you’re basing this statement on, that’s an absurd statement.
What specific medical data?
Or are you just repeating something you hear someone say?



^ Perfect example of trolling, right there.


Or, hear me out, dispensing medication is part of my job and I don’t tolerate people lazily making claims regarding medications?
Nah, I’m a troll for pointing out someone was wrong.

If you prescribe plaquenil and think its a drug with dangerous side effects, then you need to get replaced by a kiosk.

Yes, asshat, if you prescribe it for things it's not authorized for you might actually see dangerous side effects.

Not to mention that it's actually been shown TO have serious side effects in relation to Covid.

And they've already been spelled out to you above.
I don't know how much more information and facts we can give you if you're just going to refuse to accept reality.

You really need to stop embarrassing yourself here.
Or perhaps you can provide ANY evidence that these side effects are NOT a concern...even though experts say otherwise?

A G A I N...

This includes reports of serious heart rhythm problems and other safety issues, including blood and lymph system disorders, kidney injuries, and liver problems and failure.

Your sad deflection is duly noted.

Thanks for confirming the drug is useless, and perhaps dangerous, for Covid.
Just as the FDA, et.

says.
