Quite possibly Lurgan.


BREAKING - a man is being treated in Belfast’s RVH for symptoms associated with coronavirus.
The infection that’s caused two cities to go into lockdown in China.
@BelfastTrust told the @BBCNewsNI they did not comment on individual cases.

I think the proper thing is build a giant dome around Belfast and fumigate it.


So it turns out this virus is a killer, obviously.
But health experts have said it would only really effect those with previous medical conditions and the vulnerable elderly.

Not to be dismissive of course, but, is the virus just something the media are jumping on?


26 dead

830 cases

41,000,000 people on lockdown

The Chinese are getting a bit carried away, then again they go around Dublin wearing masks so they are a bit OTT on health shit.

Seems like scaremongering by the Gov over there, keep the people in line after the Honk Kong protests last year.


What will it do to sales of Corona?


They can build a 1000 bed hospital in 5 days.
Our flutes are clean useless.
Harris should be shot with a ball of his own sh_te.

Belfast Castle and Giants Causeway gets a bit of this action too.


Still less deadly than the seasonal flu.

The big problem is if it starts to mutate into something uncontrollable.

Doesn't really matter if countries do go into lockdown - takes 2-14 days for symptoms to appear meaning people can walk through airport controls without showing symptoms but can still transmit the virus.

However, the slow incubation period means that they have time to track down the contacts of the people affected.

While the NCH has been a complete balls up, you're hardly comparing apples with apples

We need a political system that makes things happen, instead of flaffing about, jumping on populist bandwagons.
Our judiciary, planning authorites are not fit for purpose either.
The childrens hospital is an absolute shambles.
Why the location, why the complex design, why the cost?

In the interests of balance, the Chinese government don't exactly worry too much about the will of the people in instances of both right and wrong.
