Kaiser Study Shows Pneumonia Vaccine May Prevent COVID-19 or Diminish Its Effects


A Kaiser Permanente Southern California study showed that one type of pneumonia vaccine may affect the course of COVID-19 for some older adult patients.

According to Kaiser officials, those who received the PCV13 vaccine appeared to be diagnosed less often with COVID-19 and when they were, they seemed to have less severe outcomes, the study’s senior author Dr. Sara Tartoff, a scientist with Kaiser’s Dept.
of Research and Evaluation, said today when releasing the information.

"One of the most interesting aspects of our findings was that the patients who received PCV13 received some protection against COVID-19, while those who received PPSV23, another pneumococcal vaccine, did not."

The Kaiser study was published in

The Journal of Infectious Diseases

.

While the recently authorized COVID-19 vaccines remain the most important strategy for preventing the disease, investigators found that older adults who received pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), which prevents acquisition of certain pneumococcal strains, experienced 35% lower risk of COVID-19 diagnosis than adults who did not receive the vaccine.

In contrast, an alternative pneumococcal vaccine (PPSV23), which prevents severe pneumococcal disease was not associated with protection.

The study examined electronic health records of 531,033 members of Kaiser Permanente in Southern California who were 65 years old and older from March 1, 2020 to July 22, 2020.

Among that population, 3,677 had a COVID-19 diagnosis, 1,075 were hospitalized for COVID-19, and 334 died from COVID-19.

Those who received PCV13 had a 35% lower incidence of COVID-19 diagnosis, 32% lower incidence of COVID-19 hospitalization and 32% lower incidence of COVID-19 death, the study showed.
