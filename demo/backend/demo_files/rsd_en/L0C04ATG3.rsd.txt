COVID-19 is losing its potency, is a myth based on hope not data



The rampant virus has the whole world in panic stricken state.
Global cases have exceeded a whopping nine million with death toll reaching 477,584.
However, recently an Italian doctor claimed that the COVID-19 is losing its potency and may go away on its own.
The doctor further stated that in reality, the virus clinically does not exist in Italy.
Many others supported his analysis by claiming that the virus is indeed different than the first outbreak.


However, as hopeful as the statement seems, in reality the novel coronavirus is not losing its potency.
Faheem Younas, Chief of infectious diseases working at University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health says:

Myth: COVID is losing its potency.
Will die down soon (on its own).

Fact: This claim is based on hope, not data.
COVID went from 1-500,000 global cases in 86 days.
It’s now adding 500,000 new cases every 3-4 days!
Hope is not a plan.
Test/Trace/Isolate/Facemask/hand wash is.


Let’s be very clear on this, the virus is still wreaking havoc around the globe.
Also, the fact is, it has yet to reach its peak in Pakistan.
Instead of holding onto false hope the best we can do is ensue precautionary measures and follow SOPs.
