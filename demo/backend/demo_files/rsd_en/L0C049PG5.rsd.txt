Disinfo: US created the Coronavirus in 2015 and named it SHC014


A report published by the American magazine "Nature", known for its seriousness, adds "insult to injury" regarding the COVID-19 Coronaviurs.
The report published on the 12th of November 2015 states that US scientists created a hybrid version of a coronavirus for bats related with a virus that causes SARS, called "SHC014" in a laboratory.

Conspiracy theory about the 2019-nCoV coronavirus.

There is no basis to the claim that 2019-nCoV coronavirus was man-made.
Volume 9 medical Journal "Emerging Microbes Infections" published a study in 2020 entitled "No credible evidence supporting claims of the laboratory engineering of SARS-CoV-2" in which rumours about the epidemic being constructed inside laboratories are clearly dismissed.
Regarding the 2015 study mentioned in the article, this is also addressed in the medical Journal as follows:

"Another claim in Chinese social media points to a Nature Medicine paper published in 2015, which reports the construction of a chimeric CoV with a bat CoV S gene (SHC014) in the backbone of a SARS CoV that has adapted to infect mice (MA15) and is capable of infecting human cells.
However, this claim lacks any scientific basis and must be discounted because of significant divergence in the genetic sequence of this construct with the new SARS-CoV-2 (>5,000 nucleotides)".
