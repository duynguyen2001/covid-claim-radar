Are masks mandatory on the streets?


Hi, we're travelling to Malta this Wednesday and I would like to know if it is mandatory to wear face masks when walking down the streets, or say, when going to the toilet in a restaurant/cafe/bar, or when at the beach?

I saw on Friday the regulations changed a bit, but I just want to make sure I got it right.
Thanks a lot!


Hello, - Masks are mandatory only in shops.
Good Having arrivedÂ© in Malta


Masks are compulsary in shops and public places where it is impossible to keep a distance of less than 2 metres.
