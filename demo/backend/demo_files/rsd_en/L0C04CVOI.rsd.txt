Remdesivir labeled "not effective," still in use at Baptist Memorial Hospital



MEMPHIS, Tenn.
(WMC) - The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends not using Remdesivir, a drug shown to shorten recovery time for COVID-19 patients; however, Baptist Memorial Hospital is still using the medication.

WMC first told viewers about Remdesivir back in May.
Since then, several studies on the drug have been released indicating it shortens recovery time for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

"A cut of 15 to 10 days in duration of illness to cut down hospitalization days becomes a very important significant factor," Threlkeld said.

Threlkeld says Baptist Memorial plans to continue using Remdesivir and believes it can really help this holiday season, especially as they see are seeing an increase in patients.

Threlkeld admits Remdesivir is no solution and says there are 70 vaccines in development with Moderna and Pzifer both applying for emergency use authorization.
