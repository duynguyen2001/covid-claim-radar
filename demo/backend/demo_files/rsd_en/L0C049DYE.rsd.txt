BREAKING: Researchers claim 100 percent cure rate vs.
covid-19 in 100+ patient trial conducted in Ecuador, using intravenous chlorine dioxide


In Peru this is saving lives too.
Even critic covid patients with no opportunity to have an intensive care unit can be saved with it.


You'd think the media would be all over this, and Doctors, health, government and scientists would be scrambling over walls to do their own tests and get this out as soon as possible to end lockdown, save lives, and bring the economy back.

Remember that the next time you start talking about how we should all be wearing masks...


The pharmaceutical industry is the definitive example of greed.
They hid a broad spectrum disinfectant which indiscrimiately kills a wide range of pathogens in favor of selectively targeting each pathogen with a customized drug that only addressed the symptoms of the disease that pathogen created.
It seems they made medicine overly complex and at the same time failed to cure disease.
They engaged in scientific fraud.
Isn't this the reason the FDA was created?
To prevent fraudulent practices from being used on the unsuspecting public?
It would seem that there are many who work for the FDA who should be sitting in prison, especially those who have benefitted financially from deceiving consumers at the same time working to hide beneficial things like ClO2 from them.
At what point do these people start being held responsible for the death and suffering of their victims?
How many millions of people have died from a disease they were told was incurable, who otherwise would have been cured if not for the deliberate actions by Big Pharma and the FDA's criminal conspiracy to hide the cures?
The huge responsibility of serving the public's interest involving health cannot be overstated.


Groundbreaking article.
I can access that ICU doctor's channel just fine though.


Would intravenous ozone or hydrogen peroxide also work?


Yes Jason, Ozone therapy has proven effectiveness in the Spanish and Chinese studies.
Check out the ISCO3 website (International Scientific Committee on Ozone Therapy) Regards, Wayne McCarthy ND President: Ozone Therapy Association of NZ


Yes, but those are both less selective and at a slightly higher voltage than chlorine dioxide.
I saw a testimony where someone said they used hydrogen tablets to get rid of corona as well.


This makes swimming pool shops first stop for anyone worried about getting sick, amazing, something else amazing about evil pandemic doctors, and really bad bad vaccine holocaust causing so much are thmisery.

Jews are the beneficiaries of private medicine but it doesn't follow that medical science is corrupt, Jews are only a small minority positioned at the top but only a small minority are Jews most doctors and nurses are dedicated people.

These Jews selling this garbage should be locked up but it shows what people can get away with these days.


I just want to mention that as we point out the fraud of the pharmaceutical industry it can be taken one step further to point out the the personal fraud of those profiting from all of this.
Clearly those in control of Big Pharma are not doing God's will which calls into question the authenticity of their claim of being Jewish.
Going down this rabbit hole exposes yet another giant fraud of those who claim to be Jewish but are not.
Revelations 2:9 reveals this fraud to us.

Revelations 2:9 I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.

While I believe there are Jews in this world who do still believe in God, I think there are many more who claim they are something they are not and use the status of "God's Chosen" people for their own benefit.


I posted a link to the ClO2 treatment numerous times on several threads on Twitter yesterday.
I'll check later to see if they have been removed.
We now have a cheap and effective early intervention with HCL+zinc (within 3 days of symptoms or on test result) and a later term cheap and effective treatment with IV ClO2.
These must not detract from the preventative dietary action that we all need.
The rest, of course, is being labelled by trolls as "conspiracy theory".
Trump was right about HCL and "disinfectant".
How did he know, before the studies were published?
MSM and Dems are apoplectic.

Getting enough iodine, selenium, vitamin D, K2, C and magnesium levels up is likely to do much more.
When the body has enough iodine, other areas of it become saturated providing more protection from invaders.
Most people barely have enough iodine for the thyroids needs, let alone the other areas of the body.

Sodium bicarbonate and organic sulfur are also important.
In fact, since everything works together there would be too much to mention.
But covid is killing so many because there is a focus on drugs, rather than nutrition.

In a body that is oxygenated, and iodine sufficient, covid wouldn't stand a chance.


I caught the coronavirus about a month ago when I was on the road driving a truck.
The symptoms didn't appear until after I returned to Florida for a break.
I've used MMS to heal a serious ear infection.
However, I left my MMS in Illinois by mistake when returning to Florida.
The symptoms came on more quickly than a normal flu and I rarely get the flu.
I didn't expect to catch anything but I was in truckstops every day and deliveries and pickups and supermarkets in the midwest and southern states.
I began taking high dose iodine, selenium, vitamin D3, and magnesium but it was like a bad flu in my head and somewhat in my body and wasn't improving after a couple of days.
I had more MMS on order and then I remembered that I have hydrogen tablets called Vital Reaction, an amazing product.
I began taking a tablet dissolved in water every hour or sooner and in less than 24 hours almost all of the symptoms were gone except for minor congestion which took several days to pass.
The lungs seem to be targeted by the virus which is confirmed by some reports of serious cases.


Germanium supplies the body with oxygen and has cured many health problems where oxygen was required....A Japanese researcher, Dr. Kazuhiko Asai, studied Germanium for many years and wrote a 42 page report on his findings.

There was so much outrage when Trump mentioned disinfecting the blood...but no one bats an eyelid when people inject themselves with vaccines containing them.


Yes Trump was correct like I said a hundred times to anybody who would listen April 23rd 2020 was a legendary day.
The day that a country's LEADER would finally bring to everyone's attention the antiviral properties of chlorine dioxide.


It's a shame Trump keeps on going on about hydroxychloroquine, instead of chlorine dioxide though.
it would be much safer for him, and anyone else to use too.


My thoughts exactly.
Does Hydroxychloroquine even cure malaria?
ClO2 does in 4 hours.
ClO2 is the real star in this show capable of curing hundreds of diseases.
Why isn't Trump talking about ClO2?
Even though he didn't discover it his presidency surely would benefit from the introduction of ClO2 to the American people.
His initiative to expose this would be historically one of the greatest things a U.S. president has ever done for the American people.
Anyone involved in bringing to an end to Big Pharma's sick manipulations of our health for their own profits is doing a great service to their fellow man.


Jim Humble told us ClO2 cured malaria in 4 hours.
The Red Cross witnessed this in Uganda, but then denounced Humble and his team and denied ClO2 worked.
The pharmaceutical industry had developed Hydroxychloroquine which has been used to treat malaria.
I don't know if it actually cures it, but I have the feeling it does not.

Jim Humble says ClO2 will cure all forms of C*****.
You can't actually say the word because there are some people who get really upset when they hear that.
It's just something to think about.


The Red Cross used to be a good organization, but now they're corrupt and an arm of the pharmaceutical companies.
They've also had a hand in the many atrocities caused by vaccines in third world countries.


I feel a bit strange here in this comment section because there are so many here who know the truth about ClO2 and I'm used to being attacked for saying anything about it.
That's not happening here and it is quite wonderful.
I have been talking about ClO2 for several years now online and have been threatened, had comments removed and been accused of trying to hurt people all because Big Pharma has laid down a blanket of intimidation and lies in order to protect their corrupt medicine market.
We need to spread the word and use this article and any subsequent articles involving these cured Covid-19 patients in Ecuador as evidence of what "we" already know so others can share in the "miracle" of ClO2.
We have a responsibility to those who have yet to discover ClO2, to inform them of the lies the pharmaceutical industry has been telling them.
Already the physical and financial suffering that has occurred because of the corrupt medical industry is incalculable.
So many have died from disease that could have been cured if not for people who put their profits before the lives of others.
I never believed that God would make curing disease so very complicated that we would require all these scientists working in laboratories to create complex medicines to treat us.
This becomes much more evident when those medicines don't even cure the illness.
I realize there are exceptions to what I'm saying and ClO2 probably can't fix everything, but if you listen to the researchers and the testimonials from around the world you begin to realize there are many things we are living with that are called "incurable", but that really isn't the truth.


The WHO has a lot to answer for.
Their recommendations have killed hundreds of thousands of people and caused severe damage including inoperable scarring to survivors lungs.
Ozone enrichment of patient's own blood works too but similarly, has been suppressed.


That's managed activity for the most part.
Because MMS and chlorine dioxide has gone so viral, a lot of effort is in effect to attempt to prevent the spread of information beyond the alternative health crowd.
Sponsored activity on internet forums is very common today for both commercial and politically oriented purposes.
Special interests want no mainstream consciousness regarding something as effective as MMS, along with related information being shared by such people concerning health and the medical system.
The more that people begin to wake up, the more they begin to think for themselves and exit the usual methods of division in politics and the attempts to restart racial division, gender bias etc.


I agree, ClO2 can't fix everything, however it can fix 95% of "things"... ;)


DMSO can possibly fix a lot of the rest!
if not, the two combined may be able to.
I know someone that used DMSO gel with aloevera on wrinkles...and after 2 days, their cataracts started improving.


The inflammation connection was personally to me as I took lots of Bromelain when I got infected with the Wuhan virus in December.
The oxygen connection was also personal as I used 3% food grade hydrogen peroxide in a nebulizer cup with a couple drops of iodine and "vaped" deeply, inhaling around 10-15 times several times a day.
I also ingested 10 drops 35% H202 in distilled water 3X a day.
In addition to these I used anti virals but could tell the oxygen and anti-inflammatory was helping the most.
I've used H202 for many years knowing that viruses cannot survive in an oxygen rich environment.


Glad more people are getting this info.
No antibiotics in 15 yrs, since I started using H2O2!
Knocks out infections within days.
A gift from God!


It is only one of many of God's gifts, but most of the posts are pushing drugs.
They still don't know that there are plenty of effective natural treatments that are far superior.


Really interesting and hopeful report.
However, I think there are two problems that need correction with the writing.
First, the title - Researchers claim - infers that this is an unsubstantiated claim, not a medical research finding.
Big difference.
A good title would be Medical Researchers in Ecuador report intravenous chlorine dioxide had a 100 percent cure rate vs.
covid-19 in 100+ patient trial.

Two: Present the criminal medical cartels are censoring all treatments and cures that work to save lives as a separate article.


I can only hope that this information makes it to the ears of Donald Trump so that he can demand this information is made known to EVERYONE!


This article had been banned by FB.


Put it on Parler.com


This is my first time ever...commenting on anything on the Internet.
I am a POLICE OFFICER extremely skeptical of everything (sorry).
My husband told me about MMS after listening to a podcast a year ago.
Long story short, he ordered it I can tell you, it does work.
I watched him use it, as a guinea pig, still waited for months, to try it.
I did, to this day, I can say, it does work.
I then used MMS 2, to get rid of a UTI.
It cleared up IN 2 DAYS.
Any woman hearing that should make her jaw drop.
No antibiotics, just MMS 2.
MMS alone my husband I use now daily (we are both officers) , because it detoxifies the body period.
We have to deal with the public so this brings me comfort.
I'm not some homeopathic person, but now.......I'm becoming one.
Sorry for the rant.
We stocked up before the FDA shut Genesis2church down from selling it.
We have the books.
I recommend ordering them.
It will show you how to order/make MMS on your own.
We are looking into this since we do not know when we will be able to order this again.
About 5 other POLICE OFFICERS on our shift started to use MMS with great results.
Do we get ridiculed criticized by others on our shift?
Yes....BUT, we are in charge of our health don't care what ppl think.
Although we work for the government, we are not stupid.
We are Non denominational Christians, took an oath to uphold the Bill of Rights the Constitution, love Jesus, want to help ppl as much as we can believe....if something works for us regarding our health, then we are sticking to it!
What do you have to lose?
Try it!
God Bless!

Germanium supplies oxygen to all parts of the body and was studied for years by a Japanese researcher who wrote a 42 page report available on the web.... https://www.regenerativenut...


Your comment was so interesting and great to hear!
Just beware that the chlorine in the dioxide can complete with iodine in the thyroid and probably elsewhere in the body.
Therefore you should take steps to correct this.
It seems that few people realize this and that can undo all of the good work that chlorine dioxide can do for the body.
I recommend you read the book 'iodine why we need it' by David Brownstein if you aren't already aware.
Or maybe you are already supplementing with lugols iodine and selenium?

Spread the word.
It was several weeks before I noticed the iodine depletion and put two and two together.
Some people will not notice it at all.


CLO2 does not oxidize iodine in the body.
Otherwise people would have recognizied and some wouldn't have been cured of Hashimoto.

There are people out there taking it for a long time.
I am using it personally for over 10 years without any adverse effects.

These things would have been noticied if you did hurt your thyroid with it.

Most likely your issue is cost by a pathogen CLO does not destroy.

I read your comments about Andreas Kalcker and they are wrong likewise I commented under it so you see the proof over there.
Without him all those studies in 2020 and everything else wouldn't been carried out.


It's discussed here https://www.bbc.co.uk/bites...

''A more reactive halogen can displace a less reactive halogen from solutions of its salts.
For example, chlorine is more reactive than iodine.
A solution of chlorine can displace iodine from potassium iodide solution:''

I'm not sure if anything changes due to the dioxide part of chlorine, but after supplementing with more iodine after chlorine dioxide use, I noticed a big difference.


Chlorine Dioxide reacts through oxidation and the compounds that are afterwards created are chlorite, chloride, chlorate and not chlorine.
This is an entirely different substance and have different chemistries.
Chlorine reacts through "chlorination" and then afterwards carcinogenic substances are created.
I just quote, you can look up the website yourself: "Is chlorine dioxide a halogen source for chlorination of organics?
No.
Although chlorine is part of the chemical structure of ClO2, a key chemical attribute of ClO2 reaction chemistry is that it does not produce halogenated DBPs from the oxidized compound.
ClO2 only reacts with substances that give up electrons in true redox reactions....."


Have you seen this yet?Great video!

https://www.brighteon.com/8...

''Andreas Kalcker interviewed by the Health Ranger about chlorine dioxide, science and truth''


It's not oxidation, it's halogen displacement.
Chlorine displaces iodine in the body due to atomic weight.
Unless the chlorine in chlorine dioxide reacts differently, I can't see how this would be any different.
And not everyone will notice the occurrence because it can take a long time.
Most of the population are already iodine deficient and have no idea they are.
Also, if you have sufficient iodine, this iodine displaced won't make a difference, but it is something to be aware of.

My comments about Andreas Kalcker are concerning a statement he keeps on repeating in multiple videos, with not one bit of proof or reference.
He talks about chlorine dioxide being used to disinfect blood in transfusions, and says that it is mandatory for all governments.
Where is the evidence?
if it is mandatory there would be a document somewhere detailing its use.
Find one document proving it...no one can.
Patents showing it's use for blood disinfection are not the same thing.

One of the toxicity studies Andreas referenced when talking about human consumption was not even done on humans, it was rats!


Sorry my messages didnt came through thats why I copy pasted and now it is spammed...


"My comments...." True it is not the same.
I cannot tell you if it is obligatory or if he lied.
If you are really interested in knowing that please reach out to him.
It is patented because it is safe that is my point.
"One of....was rats! "
True, it was on rats that is the only thing he is able to prove it, because the FDA and so on says it is dangerous for ingestion etc.
Anyway those patents show and the clinical study I put out showed that it is safe for humans.
No need to bash him.
He needs more credit for bringing it to light and carrying/being part of the studies and finding out how the chlorine dioxide substance is isolated from the "original" MMS.
To your point: "Most of..." True, I would say to some degree everyone is thyroid depleted, because Fluoride replaces the iodine too and helps to build "fake thyroid" hormones, so you test in range, but are in reality iodine deficient.
That´s why some use lugol´s with caution.
I remember years ago reading about from Broda Barnes etc.
You can search for yourself.
By that theory alone, we will notice it fast if chlorine dioxide would be able to that.
That is just not the case.
Otherwise people could not have healed thyroid issues with Chlorine Dioxide - Chlorine dioxide dissolves afterwards an hour and stays not long enough in the body and works through oxidation and does not halogen replacement because it is a different substance then chlorine.
On the book of HRP of Jim Humble you see that MMS does not kill everything, even aggravates seldomly cases like for fungus.
It kills candida entirely, but not all fungi.
On Kerri Rivera´s/Andreas Kalcker´s books you find out that some worms are not destroyed through MMS.
Sometimes they come out by themselves or they still stay in the body and cause harm.
In your case I would of course supplement slightly with Lugol´s way less then they tell you.
And avoid all foods that contains bromine and water that contains flouride.
Furthermore then going with HRP of Jim Humble and that is left have to be worms not oxidizied through MMS1/MMS2 and killing through zeolite/bentonite/diatomaceous earth.

It takes time till my messages are accepted I guess.
I have already written hours ago a message back to you.

You can find more Kerri Rivera´s homepage under health news, then scroll down to the CLO2 Video.
So you see it is not from MMS/CDS proponents.

"My comments about Andreas Kalcker are concerning a statement he keeps on repeating in multiple videos, with not one bit of proof or reference.
He talks about chlorine dioxide being used to disinfect blood in transfusions, and says that it is mandatory for all governments."
True it is not the same.
I cannot tell you if it is obligatory or if he lied.
If you are really interested in knowing that please reach out to him.
It is patented because it is safe that is my point.

"One of the toxicity studies Andreas referenced when talking about human consumption was not even done on humans, it was rats! "

True, it was on rats that is the only thing he is able to prove it, because the FDA and so on says it is dangerous for ingestion etc.
Anyway those patents show and the clinical study I put out showed that it is safe for humans.
No need to bash him.
He needs more credit for bringing it to light and carrying/being part of the studies and finding out how the chlorine dioxide substance is isolated from the "original" MMS.

To your point: "Most of the population are already iodine deficient and have no idea they are.
Also, if you have sufficient iodine, this iodine displaced won't make a difference, but it is something to be aware of."

True, I would say to some degree everyone is thyroid depleted, because Fluoride replaces the iodine too and helps to build "fake thyroid" hormones, so you test in range, but are in reality iodine deficient.
That´s why some use lugol´s with caution.
I remember years ago reading about from Broda Barnes etc.
You can search for yourself.

By that theory alone, we will notice it fast if chlorine dioxide would be able to that.
That is just not the case.
Otherwise people could not have healed thyroid issues with Chlorine Dioxide - Chlorine dioxide dissolves afterwards an hour and stays not long enough in the body and works through oxidation and does not halogen replacement because it is a different substance then chlorine.
On the book of HRP of Jim Humble you see that MMS does not kill everything, even aggravates seldomly cases like for fungus.
It kills candida, but not everything about it.
On Kerri Rivera´s/Andreas Kalcker´s books you find out that some worms are not destroyed through MMS.
Sometimes they come out by themselves or they still stay in the body and cause harm.
In your case I would of course supplement slightly with Lugol´s way less then they tell you.
And avoid all foods that contains bromine and water that contains flouride.
Furthermore then going with HRP of Jim Humble and that is left have to be worms not oxidizied through MMS1/MMS2 and killing through zeolite/bentonite/diatomaceous earth.
There is not much left.

I just quote, you can look up the website yourself:

"Is chlorine dioxide a halogen source for chlorination of organics?
No.
Although chlorine is part of the chemical structure of ClO2, a key chemical attribute of ClO2 reaction chemistry is that it does not produce halogenated DBPs from the oxidized compound.
ClO2 only reacts with substances that give up electrons in true redox reactions.
Therefore, ClO2 functions as a highly selective oxidant when it reacts with organic compounds, because it only attacks electron-rich bonds in the organic compounds.
In true oxidation the organic give up electrons to the chlorine dioxide molecule.

In contrast, because pH impacts the reaction chemistry of chlorine, it can attach a chlorine atom or substitute a chlorine atom into an organic compound, which leads to the formation of undesirable chlorinated organics, such as chloroform, bromoform, dioxins or THMs.
These halogenated DBPs are coming under increasing regulatory pressure around the globe.

The predictable redox reaction chemistry of ClO2 with organics is also important, because it significantly reduces the formation potential of halo acetic acid precursors, such as aldehydes, ketones and ketoacids, which then lowers the potential for THM formation in finished treated drinking water."


I hope that helps and to clarify:

"On the book of HRP of Jim Humble you see that MMS does not kill everything, even aggravates seldomly cases like for fungus.
It kills candida, but not everything about it."
= It kills not every family of fungus, but yes Candida it does kill in case you thought about it.


Wow!

Thank you Jennifer for this great testimonial!

I can also attest to the almost unbelievable properties of MMS for it healed my chronic bronchitis and eczema.

If we spread this information and more-and-more people start to use MMS(Chlorine Dioxide) than we will reach a critical mass when the effects of this substance can no longer be publicly denied.

The key is to start to use it in low, responsible doses and follow the instructions of the inventor Jim Humble which he laid out in his book: https://jimhumble.co/bookstore

I firmly believe Jim found a universal medicine against ALL types of viruses, bacteria, fungi etc.
and which also binds the toxins/heavy metals in our bodies.
Our immune system will recover by itself when you get rid of the substances suppressing it.

The reason why the gatekeepers of the medical establishment(FDA, CDC...
etc.)
are crapping their pants over Chlorine Dioxide because with MMS you can now buy(or produce) your own medicine for less than $20 PER PERSON PER YEAR!
:)
