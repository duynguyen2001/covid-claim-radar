When Did Covid Actually Begin?


Scientists have been trying to piece together a timeline for the Covid outbreak for months.
The first official warning about the danger the infection posed was in mid February, but evidence is surfacing that Covid had expanded the the western hemisphere much earlier.

Blood test analyses have found infections in the US as early as December in California, Oregon, Washington, and other states.
Similar analyses conducted in Europe show similar findings, claiming that Italy had Covid cases as early as September 2019.
France had a cases in December, and Spain found traces in sewage.

To make all of this worse, leaked documents to CNN prove that the Chinese covered up thousands of cases at the beginning of the global outbreak.
This information could have been vital to saving thousands of lives.
China claimed to have almost one hundred thousand cases and almost half that in deaths.
This, compared to a much better ratio of cases to deaths in all of the western world, should indicate that China has been less than truthful about their Covid numbers.

What this should indicate to the rest of the world is that China is a bad actor on the world stage.
It is clear, based only on Covid response, that China can not be trusted and should show that China is not ready to be recognized as an ally in any capacity.

But there is some good news.
Multiple companies have applied for emergency use of their vaccines which should be available early next year.
These vaccines are shown to be over 90% affective in preventing Covid.
After these vaccines get distributed, hopefully we can get back to normal life.
