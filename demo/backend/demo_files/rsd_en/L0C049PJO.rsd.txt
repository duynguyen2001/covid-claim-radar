Serious question: Can the virus be spread via packages/parcels?


If it’s shipped with air travel and not temperature controlled, then no, you are safe.
If it’s been shipped for more than 3-4 days, you are also safe as the virus would degenerate by then.


Read this Paper from the American Society for Microbiology: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2863430/

Warmer temperatures destroys the virus faster, but cool temperatures protect it.

In theory it can survive (based on other Coronaviruses tested) for upto 28 days.
So if I was handling a lot of packages from China and dealing with co-worker who do I'd be very concerned.
It would probably be sensible for Amazon workers to down tools for 6 months until this passes and the Government to stop all trade from China for at least 6 months.


my package took like 5 months to arrive.
i got it last week.
do you think it is infected??
