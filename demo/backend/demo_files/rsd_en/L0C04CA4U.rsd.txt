If you are vaccinated, do you wear a mask outdoors?
Why or why not?



If you are fully vaccinated and you wear a mask outdoors - not including places like farmers markets or crowded plazas, just outdoors for a walk - why?
Or why not?
Do you think itâ€™s still necessary as a health practice?
Or as a solidarity thing?
Do you think we can ever just walk around outside as normal?




of course not.
I never was necessary as a health practice.




No.
I didnâ€™t when I wasnâ€™t vaccinated.
I stayed 6â€™ away.




A walk in my neighborhood or on quiet streets in Old Town?
I never did.
King Street on the weekend, yes.
But it's not an evidence based concept.




no, of course not.
i didn't wear a mask outside before i was vaccinated, either.
i always wondered about those people...so bizarre.




I do.
Itâ€™s the law here




Only if other people are nearby.
And even then itâ€™s only for their comfort, not mine.
Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been doing for the past year.




Yes.
For one thing, I believe they are still required if youâ€™re going to be within 6 feet of someone, per the DC government, irrelevant of vaccine status.
I live in DC in a very walkable neighborhood, and there are always lots of people on the sidewalk.
I do think that itâ€™s necessary for unvaccinated people for health reasons.
While, as a fully vaccinated person, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s necessary for health reasons, the people Iâ€™m walking by have no way of knowing Iâ€™m vaccinated, and I donâ€™t want to make anyone uncomfortable.
I believe once vaccines are widely available and community spread has dropped, they will no longer be necessary.
But I feel no need to be on the vanguard.
It doesnâ€™t bother me much at all - Iâ€™m fine waiting for health authorities to give the all clear.

Where?
Nowhere in the US is it a law that you must be masked when you can maintain social distance outside.

Oh, I should add, if I was in a situation where I wasnâ€™t going to be within six feet of people, I wouldnâ€™t, but that literally never happens to me because of where I live.




No.
I wear a mask where I am told I must wear a mask.
That is all.

It's not necessary for health reasons in and of itself, but erring on the side of caution is probably better than going the other way in terms of public health.
It's possible that if people weren't encouraged to mask in slightly crowded outdoor spaces there would be creep and eventually people would say to themselves, "I'll only be in the store for 2 or 3 minutes so I don't need a mask."
A lot of the country is like this, but I don't think they even think about it.
They just think, "I don't like masks.
They're for pussies."

PP here.
Per this article: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cor...es-during-covid19/art-20489385 "When you're outside, fresh air is constantly moving, dispersing these droplets.
So you're less likely to breathe in enough of the respiratory droplets containing the virus that causes COVID-19 to become infected.
But be sure to wear a mask when you can't maintain distance from others."
I have no need to second guess The Mayo Clinic and the local public health authorities when all theyâ€™re asking me to do is wear a mask.
Itâ€™s just not that big a deal.




Not at all when walking my neighborhood, though i always have it in hand to throw on if someone is passing out of respect.
You should see how up in a tizzy our local listservs are about this !!
People really are passionate about it so rather than ruin their day, I play into their illusions to appease them.
I also put it on when in public outside places concentrated with people, like around Millieâ€™s or heart of Georgetown sidewalks.
Geez I just outed myself with that last sentence ðŸ˜¬
