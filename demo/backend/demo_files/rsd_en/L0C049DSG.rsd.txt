Giuliani says Dr. Fauci funded Wuhan virology lab in spite of official prohibition


Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, revealed that he believes White House coronavirus expert Dr.
Anthony Fauci knew more about the Wuhan virology lab he is letting on.

Giuliani explained during a Sunday interview with

The Cats Roundtable

that in 2014, the Obama administration had "prohibited" the allocation of federal funds to all virology labs, even in the US.

"Despite that, Dr. Fauci gave $3.7 million to the Wuhan laboratory," Giuliani claimed.
"And then even after the State Department issued reports about how unsafe that laboratory was, and how suspicious they were in the way they were developing a virus that could be transmitted to humans, we never pulled that money."


The Daily Mail reported that the National Institutes for Health, which is headed up by Dr. Fauci, awarded a $3.7 million grant to the Wuhan lab in 2015.

"So, something here is going on, John.
I don’t want to make any accusations," the former NYC mayor added.


"But there was more knowledge about what was going on in China with our scientific people than they disclosed to us when this first came out.
Just think of it: If this laboratory turns out to be the place where the virus came from, we paid for it.
We paid for the damn virus that’s killing us."

Reports are mounting that the virus was leaked from a virology lab located just miles from the controversial wet market in Wuhan that was originally blamed for spawning the virus.
The matter is still under investigation.

Giuliani pressed for a more official probe, however, remarking that "today, if I were U.S. attorney, I’d open an investigation into the Wuhan laboratory."

"And I’d want to know, what did we know?
How much did we know about how bad the practices were there?
Who knew about it?
And who sent them money anyway?
And that person would sure as heck be in front of a grand jury trying to explain to me — what are you asleep?"
